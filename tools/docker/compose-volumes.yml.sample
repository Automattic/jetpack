## List volumes for plugins, themes, and so on here. Format is a sequence as appropriate for
## docker-compose's service.volumes. In brief,
##  - Begin each line with a "-" followed by a space.
##  - Line consists of two fields, local path and docker path, separated by a colon.
##  - Local path may be absolute, or relative to this file by beginning with "./" or "../".
##  - Remote path must be absolute, and should be inside a WordPress install path at /var/www/html.

## WordPress itself. You probably don't want to delete this.
- ./wordpress:/var/www/html

## The Monorepo. Don't delete this. Think of it as the flux capacitorâ€”it makes time travel possible.
- ../..:/usr/local/src/jetpack-monorepo

## Must Use Plugins directory. See tools/docker/README.md
- ./mu-plugins:/var/www/html/wp-content/mu-plugins
