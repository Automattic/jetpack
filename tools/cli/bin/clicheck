/**
 * This is an empty file.
 *
 * It is just here to confirm that `jetpack-clicheck#####` command listed in the package.json's bin section has been linked.
 *
 * When adding a new command to the CLI, it won't work unless it is added to package.json and,
 * since isn't a separate package, symlinked using `yarn link`.
 *
 * If `yarn link` has already been run for the monorepo, it won't work, so it has to be unlinked, then linked.
 *
 * To avoid anyone really needing to know this, `yarn cli-init` will `yarn install` to pick up any new deps, then both
 * `yarn unlink` and `yarn link` to get everything ready for the CLI.
