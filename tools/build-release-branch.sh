# This script can build a new set of release branches, or update an existing release branch.
# It doesn't care which branch you're currently standing on.
#
# Building a new set of release branches: "new" | "-n"
# It takes a parameter "new", which should only be used when preparing a new major release (x.x), not a point release.
#
# The "new" parameter will request a version number. It should be the version format "x.x" (example 4.9)
# It will then create a new (unbuilt) branch with the specific naming convention of "branch-x.x", and push it to the repo.
# It will also create another (built) branch with the specific naming convention of "branch-x.x-built",
#   push it to the repo, and build a production version to it.
#
# Updating an existing built branch: "update" | "-u"
# The "update" parameter will request an existing branch name to build to.
# It will then build Jetpack and commit to that target branch.

# Exit the build in scary red text if error
