=== How To Translate Jetpack ===

== Who translates Jetpack? How can I get involved? ==

Anyone can help by suggesting new translations [here](http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/jetpack/). No need to use a Translation Editor, you can do it all from [GlotPress](http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/jetpack/)!

Once you've suggested a new translation, a GlotPress validator will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically included in the next Jetpack release.

== How does GlotPress work? ==

You can find detailed GlotPress documentation on [this page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/glotpress/).

== Who decides which languages are available? I want my language added ==

If you can't find your language in GlotPress, [send us an email](http://jetpack.me/contact-support/) and we'll add it for you.

== I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language? ==

You'll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page in GlotPress.
