plugin management interface -- these notices will no longer appear.

feature.

right from custom post type single and archive views.

* Shortcodes: handy links to shortcode documentation convey the types of media
you can quickly and safely embed.

without making you refresh the entire page. Live previews, yes indeed.

those types of comments. Our bad.
