# Shared front-end libraries

These libraries should be considered self-contained (similar to NPM modules) and are meant to be used between block editor extensions (in `/extensions`) and Jetpack dashboard (in `/_inc/client`).

Note that if the code is used in Calypso, you might want to consider publishing to NPM from the [Calypso monorepo](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/3d8f537ee1beab7b6c9c0316978f6f41fb61e2b4/docs/monorepo.md) instead.
