### Admin Page

We've made several changes to the Admin Page in this release. This will have a big impact on new and existing Jetpack users alike. It impacts multiple screens and flows:

- You will notice changes when heading to Jetpack > Dashboard right after activating the plugin.
- You will notice a new card when coming back to your dashboard right after connecting the plugin to your WordPress.com account.
- You will notice some changes in the modals that are displayed in the Jetpack dashboard when coming back to your site after purchasing a plan.
- You will find a new "My Plan" section in the Jetpack dashboard.
- The sections and cards under Jetpack > Settings were also reorganized.
- We've starting working on improving the different notices that are displayed to you when changing settings.
- We've updated the message displayed to users who have not linked their own WordPress.com account on a site that is already using Jetpack.

To test this, try navigating through all those screens as a new site owner:

- Can you dismiss / use all action buttons?
- Can you find all sections and features you are looking for?
- Can you easily upgrade to a new plan?
- Can you toggle the different settings in the new "Performance" section?
- Do you spot any typos or mistakes in the texts that were added to the different screens?

### Block Editor

This release introduces new blocks we'd like you to test:

**Subscription block**

This block allows your readers to subscribe to your site, and will be available in the block editor if the Subscriptions feature is active on your site. To test it, try to activate the feature, and see if you can add the block, and use it to subscribe to your site.

**VR Block**

This block allows one to embed a VR viewer in their posts. It is available as soon as you connect Jetpack to WordPress.com. Try to use the block and see if it is displayed properly on your site!

**At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**

**Thank you for all your help!**
