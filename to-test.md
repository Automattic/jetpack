## 8.9

### Before you start

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

### Blocks

#### Form

In this release, we've added 3 things to the Form block:
- A new "Consent" field you can add to any new or existing form.
- A new "Newsletter Sign-up" form option offered to you when you create a new form, to save you some time if you plan to use your form to collect email addresses.
- A new panel in the block's sidebar to help you integrate the Form block with a plugin that handles newsletter sign-ups, Creative Mail. In that panel, you will have the option to install and activate the plugin if you do not use it on your site yet.

You can try to use those new options and let us know if everything works well.

### Connection

We've made a number of changes to better couple your site's connection to WordPress.com with the status of features like Protect, Monitor, Subscriptions, or Stats on your site.

To test this, on a new or existing site, ensure that toggling those features on and off still works, and that the features themselves still work.

**Thank you for all your help!**
