## 7.0

### Block Editor

This release adds one more block to the list of blocks available in Jetpack. The Gif block will allow you to quickly search and add images to your posts. To test it, load the block editor and search for the new Gif block. You should then be able to search for images using any keyword, choose an image, and add a caption if you want to. The image should be displayed nicely on the front end of your site.

### Others

**Thank you for all your help!**
