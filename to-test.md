### Blocks

#### Google Calendar

We've created a new Google Calendar block that will allow you to quickly embed calendars within your posts and pages. Give the block and its options a try, and let us know if you run into any issues.

#### Map

We've made a lot of changes to the Map block in this release.

We would encourage you to test all features offered by the block, including the new Zoom, height, and Fullscreen options appearing in the block sidebar. Give those features a try in the editor, and check how the map looks like on your site's frontend as well.

#### Tiled Gallery

The Tiled Gallery block now comes with some new options:

- You can choose rounded corners for your galleries.
- You can reorder images within a gallery thanks to previous / next arrows appearing on each image.

Give those features a try and let us know how it worked for you.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
