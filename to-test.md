### Blocks

#### Podcast Player

This release introduces a new Podcast Player block. This block allows you to embed any podcast into one of your posts or pages. You can choose how many tracks will be displayed, and fully customize the look of the player and its options. Your readers will then be able to play each episode in their browser.

To test, add the block to a post or a page and make sure everything works as planned.

You can use just about any podcast feed you may know about.

#### Revue

We've made changes to the Revue block, and added customization options to the button as well as the different fields. Try editing an existing Revue block, or create a new Revue block and use the different customization options.

### Carousel

We've made several changes to the Carousel feature in this release. You'll want to test the feature, with and without the AMP plugin, and ensure it still works well in AMP views as well as on desktop.

### Publicize

We've made some changes to the default behaviour when publicizing to Twitter accounts. Until now, when you would publish a new post with an image, that image would be uploaded and attached to the Publicized tweet. From now on, when you do publish a post, Publicize will let Twitter build a preview card for the tweet, based on the link above. Please try publishing some posts with Publicize to Twitter activated, and ensure that Publicize still works.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
