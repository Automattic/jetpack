## 9.0

### Before you start

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

### Publicize

This release introduces a new Publicize feature: you can now publish the entire content of posts to Twitter as a thread. To test this, try the following:

1. Go to Jetpack > Settings > Sharing, and enable Publicize
2. Connect your site to a Twitter account
3. Go to Posts > Add New (using the block editor).
4. Write a post, with different types of blocks. You can try as many different blocks as you can.
5. In the Jetpack sidebar, access Publicize options and you should see the option to publish to Twitter as one tweet, or a thread.
6. If you choose the thread option, you'll have more information in the block editor itself, showing you where paragraphs will get split in multiple tweets, and showing you what blocks will not be ported to Twitter.
7. Publish your post, and see what happens on your Twitter account!

Let us know what you think about the process, and let us know if you find any bugs.
