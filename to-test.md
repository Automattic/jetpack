### Sync

This release brings in significant changes to "Sync", the synchronization process that keeps your site's data up to date with WordPress.com. You'll consequently want to check that on newly connected sites as well as existing sites, data gets properly synchronized with WordPress.com. That means that features like Notifications, Publicize, Related Posts should keep working properly on your site.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
