### Blocks

#### MailChimp

The MailChimp block now works well with the AMP plugin. To test this, try adding a MailChimp block to a site where you use the AMP plugin.

When visiting your site on an AMP view, you should be able to subscribe using the MailChimp block with no issues.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticible and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
