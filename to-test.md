### Widgets

#### Top Posts Widget

We added new `jetpack_top_posts_widget_layout` filter that allows you to create a custom display layout for the Top Posts widget (which _might_ be used to extend Top Posts widget).

To test:

- Add 'Top Posts' Widget
- Make sure it works as expected

**Thank you for all your help!**
