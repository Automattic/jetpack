### Connection Flow

We've made some changes to the way secondary users (any users other than the first admin who connected the site to WordPress.com) can connect to their WordPress.com account. To give it a try, create a new user on your site after connecting your Jetpack site to WordPress.com. Then, log out of both your WordPress.com account and your local admin account, and log in as this new user and head over to Jetpack > Dashboard. Try to link your WordPress.com account there and let us know what you think about your experience.

### Widgets

This release introduces a new Instagram widget. Give it a try by going to Jetpack > Settings in your dashboard, and searching for the Widgets feature. Once you've activated the feature, you should see the widget appear under Apperance > Customize and Appearance > Widgets. Give it a try and let us know what you think.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
