### Block Editor

This release introduces new blocks we'd like you to test:

**Subscription block**

This block allows your readers to subscribe to your site, and will be available in the block editor if the Subscriptions feature is active on your site. To test it, try to activate the feature, and see if you can add the block, and use it to subscribe to your site.

**VR Block**

This block allows one to embed a VR viewer in their posts. It is available as soon as you connect Jetpack to WordPress.com. Try to use the block and see if it is displayed properly on your site!

**At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**

**Thank you for all your help!**
