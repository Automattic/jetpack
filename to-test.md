### Before you start

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

### Blocks

#### Podcast Player Block

In anticipation of further changes to the Podcast Player Block and its integration with other Jetpack blocks, we've made a number of changes to the Podcast Player block. Here is what you can try:

- Insert a new block, and add a podcast
- You should now see skip back / forward buttons that you can use in the editor and on the frontend.


**Thank you for all your help!**
