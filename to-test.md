## 4.6

In Jetpack 4.6, we focused on fixing bugs and making the plugin fully compatible with PHP 7.1. We also added a brand new module, Google Analytics.

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics support on Jetpack is available as a feature of the [Professional plan](https://jetpack.com/pricing/). Visit **Jetpack → Settings → Engagement → Google Analytics** in your dashboard to enable Google Analytics.

Once the module is enabled, go to **Settings → Analytics** [on WordPress.com](https://.wordpress.com/settings/analytics) and you'll find a field where you can add your Google Analytics Tracking ID.

Once you've added the tracking ID, you should be able to see the Google Analytics tracking code in the source code of all pages on your site.

### Final Notes

During your tests, we encourage you to open your browser's Development Tools and keep the Console open, checking for any errors in the Console and the Network tabs.

To open the Console in Chrome or Firefox, you can press CMD+Alt+i in macOS or F12 in Windows.

**Thank you for all your help!**
