## 5.8

### Lazy images

Jetpack 5.8 introduces a new module, Lazy Images. This feature, once activated under Jetpack > Settings, improves performance by loading images just before they scroll into view, and not before. To test it, activate the feature and make sure that all your images are still displayed properly, regardless of how they were inserted into your posts or pages.

### Final Notes

During your tests, we encourage you to open your browser's Development Tools and keep the Console open, checking for any errors in the Console and the Network tabs.

To open the Console in Chrome or Firefox, you can press CMD+Alt+i in macOS or F12 in Windows.

We would also recommend that you check your site's `debug.log` as you test.

To make sure errors are logged on your site, you can add the following to your site's `wp-config.php` file:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );

if ( WP_DEBUG ) {

	@error_reporting( E_ALL );
	@ini_set( 'log_errors', true );
	@ini_set( 'log_errors_max_len', '0' );

	define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
	define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
	define( 'CONCATENATE_SCRIPTS', false );
	define( 'SAVEQUERIES', true );

}
```

**Thank you for all your help!**
