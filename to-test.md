### Scan

You can now purchase [Jetpack Scan](https://jetpack.com/upgrade/scan/), a Jetpack service that will scan all files on your site and offer one-click fixes to keep your site one step ahead of security threats.

We would encourage you to give the service a try, and give us your feedback on all new interface elements used by the product:

- A new submenu item appearing under the Jetpack menu when you've purchased Jetpack Scan.
- A new admin bar item appearing when threats are detected on your site.
- An updated interface under Jetpack > Dashboard and Jetpack > Settings to display the status of Scan whether you've purchased Jetpack Scan or you use one of our Jetpack Plans offering the Scan feature.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
