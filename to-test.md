## 9.3

In this release, we've focussed on improving the behaviour and reliability of the synchronization process between your site and WordPress.com. This process ensures that features such as Related Posts, Subscriptions, Publicize, and more work properly and use the latest data from your site.

To test those changes, you can try using any of those features and ensure that they're working properly.

### Before you start

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.



**Thank you for all your help!**
