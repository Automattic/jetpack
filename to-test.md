### Carousel

In this release, we've made some changes to how the Carousel metadata was added to each gallery. To test this:

* In a new post, insert a variety of blocks:
	- A classic block with a gallery
	- A classic block with a tiled gallery
	- A gallery block
	- A Tiled Gallery block
	- A column block with some text
	- A column block with a gallery block in it.
* Publish your post
* When moving your mouse over each block, make sure the cursor only becomes a pointer when the element can be expanded to a Carousel modal.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticible and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
