### Before you start

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

### Connection

We've made a number of changes to better couple your site's connection to WordPress.com with the status of features like Protect, Monitor, Subscriptions, or Stats on your site.

To test this, on a new or existing site, ensure that toggling those features on and off still works, and that the features themselves still work.

**Thank you for all your help!**
