### Widgets

This release introduces a new Instagram widget. Give it a try by going to Jetpack > Settings in your dashboard, and searching for the Widgets feature. Once you've activated the feature, you should see the widget appear under Apperance > Customize and Appearance > Widgets. Give it a try and let us know what you think.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
