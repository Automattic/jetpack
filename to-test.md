### Blocks

### OpenTable

As a restaurant owner, your ultimate goal getting online is to drive reservations to your property. The OpenTable block can help you achieve just that by facilitating visitors to quickly fill an online reservation form to book a table.

To test, add the block to a post or a page and play with its options. You can add a block for just about any restaurant that supports OpenTable. Just search for restaurants in the picker. You can also add multiple restaurants if you'd like.

We're looking for any feedback you may have about the block and the user experience around it.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
