### Blocks

#### WordPress 5.4 Compatibility

We've adapted all blocks so they can be displayed nicely in the updated editor. Give them all a try, and let us know if you find layout issues!

#### Recurring Payments

We've made some changes to this block (that requires a Premium Plan), so the buttons can be displayed properly and work well when using the AMP Plugin. On a site using that plugin, try adding a Recurring Payments button and view that button on an AMP view. You should be able to click the button and be redirected to the Payment page.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
