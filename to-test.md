### Blocks

#### Calendly

The Calendly block will be a useful tool for all coaches, consultants, therapistsâ€¦ Add the block to a post or page and anyone can then book appointments, meetings, and classes right from your website. 

To test, you have 2 options:

1. You can [create a Calendly account here](https://calendly.com) and create your own form that you'll be able to embed on your site via the block.
2. You can use an existing Calendly account like this one: `https://calendly.com/jeherve`. Paste the link into the block to get started.

Add the block to a post or a page and make sure everything works as planned. If you have your own Calendly account, try different embedding methods and see that they work well.

#### EventBrite

The EventBrite block is an easy way for your visitors to register for events right from your site.

To test, you can pick any event from [this page](https://www.eventbrite.com/) and add it to a new post on your site. Like the above, try to play with all options; we're looking for any feedback you may have about the block and the user experience around it.

#### Map

In this release we've made to the way the Mapbox access token is added to a map. If your site is hosted on WordPress.com, it's now easier than ever to get started adding maps to your post.

This change should not impact self-hosted WordPress sites. To confirm this, I would invite you to try to add a new Map Block to a new post or page on your site, and make sure that everything works properly.

#### OpenTable

As a restaurant owner, your ultimate goal getting online is to drive reservations to your property. The OpenTable block can help you achieve just that by facilitating visitors to quickly fill an online reservation form to book a table.

Give it a try and let us know what you think.

### Sync

This release brings in significant changes to "Sync", the synchronization process that keeps your site's data up to date with WordPress.com. The changes modify the initial Full Sync process and not the ongoing sync logic that powers features like Notifications, Publicize and Related Posts. Full Sync can be tested by requesting a Full Sync on WordPress.com: under Manage > Settings > General > Site Tools > Manage your connection.

### Others

- If you have the opportunity to test in an older browser like IE11, please do so. You may catch some interesting bugs!
- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

**Thank you for all your help!**
