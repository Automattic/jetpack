## 6.7.1

This release focuses on making Jetpack fully compatible with the Block Editor, also known as Gutenberg, that will be part of the new version of WordPress scheduled to be released on November 19th.

To test this Beta, it's best to be running the latest Beta version of WordPress, 5.0 Beta 3 at the moment. You can also install the new default theme, Twenty Nineteen, to test our plugin's compatibility with this as well.

To install the Twenty Nineteen theme on your site, start by downloading the latest version of the theme from [here](https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen/archive/master.zip). Unzip it, rename the folder to `twentynineteen`, rezip it, then upload and activate it on your site.

Once you are ready to start testing, we would recommend that you try the following actions:

- Activate different features, and deactivate others under Jetpack > Settings.
- Go to Posts > Add New, and ensure that you can publish new posts.
- Try updating old posts as well, and see that you can.
- Try adding some of [our shortcodes](https://jetpack.com/support/shortcode-embeds/) to your posts, and see that they work well.
- Try adding [the classic editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) plugin and see that there are no errors in the editor.
- Try publishing posts and see that Publicize and subscriptions still work.
- Try adding widgets to your site, and see that they look good with the Twenty Nineteen theme.

**At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors#Step_3:_Diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**

**Thank you for all your help!**
