I'm using the new Video widget on my actor website.
https://www.chrisrogerstheactor.com/
I use a file on vimeo. On the Desktop version, i hear video, but no video/just black (like missing codec or something).
However, it works fine on tablet/cell.
any advice? My web host WP Engine suggested I post here.
Thanx for your time/help and have a great day.
