# Join the Beta Program and help test Jetpack

Our Beta program is designed to make it simple for you to test and tell us what we’re doing wrong (and right) in the next version of Jetpack. Your mission as a Beta tester is to help us test the next version of Jetpack and let us know about your experience. Is the UI confusing? Is a feature not working properly? Is there something missing? We need to know!

Beta testers give updates, fixes, and new modules a test run before they’re publicly released, so they’re an important part of the development process.

To join our Beta group, **[download and install the Beta plugin here](http://jetpack.com/beta/).**

## Start testing

Once you've installed and activated the Beta plugin, head over to **Jetpack > Beta** in your dashboard to start testing.

## Found a bug?

If you find an issue or have remarks about a Jetpack feature, you can [send us an email](https://jetpack.com/contact-support/beta-group/), or [create an issue on GitHub.](https://github.com/Automattic/Jetpack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%5BType%5D+Bug&template=bug-report.yml)

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the URL of the page that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead. You can [check our recommendations to create great bug reports here](/docs/guides/report-bugs.md).
