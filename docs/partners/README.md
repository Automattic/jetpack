# Welcome to the Jetpack Hosting Partners Program!

To make documentation easier for our partners to view, and to ensure our partners are always viewing the most up-to-date documentation, we've decided to source-control the documentation in the Jetpack directory itself.

In this directory, you'll find information such as how to provision and cancel Jetpack plans as well as how to customize Jetpack.

If you have any technical questions or concerns, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with either Dan Walmsley (@gravityrail) at dan.walmsley@automattic.com or Eric Binnion (@ebinnion) at eric.binnion@automattic.com.
