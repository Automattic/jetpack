# Customizing Jetpack's Modules

Occasionally, hosts have asked how they could customize Jetpack's modules. The documentation below will provide use cases and instructions on how to manage modules.

### How to get a list of modules

Before we can disable or force a module on or off, we need to know the slug of the module we want to modify. To get the slugs, we have a couple of options:modules

1) You can run `wp jetpack module list` to get list of module slugs as well as the status for each module.
2) You can view the PHP files directly in the `modules` directory in Jetpack. Each PHP file that is in the top-level `modules` direcory is loaded as a module. The module slug is the file name minus the extension.

### Disabling modules

In cases where Jetpack has a competing feature with a host, it may be preferable to disable the module in Jetpack. This is easily done via a filter in Jetpack, however, we would caution hosts to consider user experience when making this decision. If a user expects a commonly used module to be available, and it's not, that could cause confusion and a support request for the host and/or Jetpack support.

Now that we've got that warning out of the way, let's get to it!

The filter that we'll use to disable a module is `jetpack_get_available_modules`. You can find documentation as well as an example for that filter here:PHP

[https://developer.jetpack.com/hooks/jetpack_get_available_modules](https://developer.jetpack.com/hooks/jetpack_get_available_modules/)

Here are a couple more alternative examples:

#### Disabling the Photon module

```php
add_filter( 'jetpack_get_available_modules', 'jetpack_docs_filter_module_example' );
function jetpack_docs_filter_module_example( $modules ) {
	if( isset( $modules['photon'] ) ) {
		unset( $modules['photon'] );
	}

	return $modules;
}
```

#### Disabling the Lazy Images module

```php
add_filter( 'jetpack_get_available_modules', 'jetpack_docs_filter_module_example' );
function jetpack_docs_filter_module_example( $modules ) {
	return array_diff_key( $modules, array( 'photon' => 'Does not matter' ) );
}
```

Note: As of Jetpack 5.8.0, there is a regression in filtering out the Photon module. While the module can be filtered out with the code above, the Jetpack admin UI shows an `undefined` string instead of hiding the setting. This behavior also applies to the Lazy Images module which was introduced in 5.8.0. This issue has been fixed in Automattic/jetpack#8780 which should go out in Jetpack 5.9.0.

### Forcing modules to be active

In some cases, a host may decide that forcing a module to be active may be preferable. For example, to minimize bandwidth on the host's server, a host could force the Photon module to be active. In these cases, it is possible to force a module on with the `jetpack_active_modules` filter.

Documentation for that filter can be found at the following URL:preferable

[https://developer.jetpack.com/hooks/jetpack_active_modules](https://developer.jetpack.com/hooks/jetpack_active_modules/)

Here's an example of how to force the Photon module to be activated:preferable

```php
add_filter( 'option_jetpack_active_modules', 'jetpack_docs_filter_active_modules' );
function jetpack_docs_filter_active_modules( $modules ) {
	return array_values( array_merge( $modules, array( 'photon' ) ) );
}
```

Note: The Jetpack admin UI isn't yet aware of this filter. So, if you force a filter to be active, the UI to enable/disable that module still displays. This issue is being tracked at this URL:
