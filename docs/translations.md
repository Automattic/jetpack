# How To Translate Jetpack

## Who translates Jetpack? How can I get involved?

Anyone can help by suggesting new translations [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/jetpack/).

Once you've suggested a new translation, [a GlotPress validator](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/) will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically shipped to all Jetpack users using WordPress in your language.

## How does GlotPress work?

You can find detailed GlotPress documentation on [this page](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/).

## I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language?

You'll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page on translate.wordpress.org.

## I found a missing translation, but I canâ€™t find the string in GlotPress

Some Jetpack modules, like Comments, Subscriptions, or Likes, are hosted on WordPress.com. Thus, you will have to look in [the WordPress.com GlotPress project](http://translate.wordpress.com/projects/wpcom/) to find the strings to translate.
