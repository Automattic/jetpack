# Contributing to Jetpack

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

Developers of all levels can help — whether you can barely recognize a filter (or don’t know what that means) or you’ve already authored your own plugins, there are ways for you to pitch in.

## Beta Testing

We're always interested in hearing your feedback about existing and upcoming Jetpack features. The easiest way to help test Jetpack is to [join our Beta group.](/docs/testing/beta-testing.md)

## Create Bug Reports

If you find a bug, please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/). If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the URL of the page that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead. You can [check our recommendations to create great bug reports here](/docs/guides/report-bugs.md).

## Write and submit a patch

If you'd like to fix a bug or make an enhancement, you can submit a Pull Request. Before you get started, you'll want to **[set up your development environment.](/docs/development-environment.md)**

Once your development environment is ready, you can get started and [create your first Pull Request!](/docs/pull-request.md)

### Get started

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to get started, you can take a look at existing issues:

- ["Good First Bug"](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/labels/%5BType%5D%20Good%20First%20Bug) issues are a good entry point to get familiar with Jetpack's code base.
- All issues labeled with [the "Good For Community" label](https://github.com/Automattic/Jetpack/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BType%5D+Good+For+Community%22) are fair game. That's a great way to contribute new features and fix small issues within Jetpack.

### We’re Here To Help

We encourage you to ask for help at any point. We want your first experience with Jetpack to be a good one, so don’t be shy. If you’re wondering why something is the way it is, or how a decision was made, you can create an issue and prefix it with “Question:”.

## Translate the plugin

If you speak a foreign language, you can help translate Jetpack into your own language. [here is how.](/docs/translations.md)
