# Social Logos
A repository of all the social logos we use on WordPress.com.

Each logo was pulled from the official branding resource of each service. Branding guidelines were adhered to as much as possible. 

For example, the Facebook guidelines state that changing the design of the "f" logo is not allowed, so a variant with a circle or sans-square instead of a square was not included in the icon set.

Some logos include an official alternate version, if it's provided by the guideline resource. Sometimes it is desirable to have a visually consistent row of icons, all enclosed with the same shape. If the guidelines permit it, then an alternate version was created with a 18dp square or 20dp circle.

For example, the Tumblr guidelines state that it's ok to enclose the logo in any shape, so there's an alternate logo with an 18dp square.
