# Social Logos
A repository of all the social logos we use.

Each logo was pulled from the offical branding resource of each service. Branding guidelines were adhered to as much as possible. 

For example, the Facebook guidelines state that changing the desgin of the "f" logo is not allowed, so a variant with a circle or sans-square instead of a square was not included in the iconset.

Some logos include an offical alternate version, if they are provided by the guideline resource. Sometimes it is desirable to have a visually consistent row of icons, all enclosed with the same shape. If the guidlines permit it, then an alternate version was created with a 18dp square or 20dp circle.
