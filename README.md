# Social Logos
A repository of all the social logos we use.

Each logo was pulled from the offical branding resource of each service. Branding guidelines were adhered to as much as possible. 

For example, the Facebook guidelines state that changing the desgin of the "f" logo is not allowed, so a variant with a circle instead of a square was not included in the iconset.

Alternate versions of the logos were included, if the guidelines allowed it.

Offical guideline resources:
