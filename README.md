# Social Logos
A repository of all the social logos we use on WordPress.com.

Each logo was pulled from the official branding resource of each service. Branding guidelines were adhered to as much as possible.

For example, the Facebook guidelines state that changing the design of the "f" logo is not allowed, so a variant with a circle or sans-square instead of a square was not included in the icon set.

Some logos include an official alternate version, if it's provided by the guideline resource. Sometimes it is desirable to have a visually consistent row of icons, all enclosed with the same shape. If the guidelines permit it, then an alternate version was created with a 18dp square or 20dp circle.

For example, the Tumblr guidelines state that it's ok to enclose the logo in any shape, so there's an alternate logo with an 18dp square.

Official guideline resources:

## Notes
- SVGs were generated by the `exporter-multi.jsx` script.
- The icon grid is based on [Gridicons](https://github.com/Automattic/gridicons) and adheres to the same rules.

### Grunt: Installing

1. Go to http://nodejs.org/ and press "Install". Follow instructions.
2. Open a terminal. Change to your social-logo directory.
3. Type `npm install`

####  Installing webfont dependencies
Some additional dependencied need to be installed to create a finer icon font.
Follow the documentation found in https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont


### Grunt: Running

Make sure you have `grunt` and `grunt-svgstore` installed (also might require `grunt-svgmin`).

In the commandline, type `grunt`. This will clean up, polish, and generate the following:

- A folder called `svg-min`. This folder contains minimized SVGs of every Social Logo. These SVGs can be dragged directly into Sketch for mockups.
- A folder called `svg-sprite`. This folder contains a single SVG sprite called `social-logos.svg`, which can be referenced using `use`. But this doesn't work in IE at all yet, eventually it will work in Edge and newer.
- A folder called `react`. This folder contains a social-logo component for use in React based environment.
- A folder called `php`. This folder contains a php file that can be used inside PHP projects. It provides you with a get_social_logo function that will returns the svg of the social logo.
- A folder called `icon-font`. This folder contains different icon font files and css files.

Do remember to update the React components where they are used, when you add a new icon.
