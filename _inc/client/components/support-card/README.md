Support Card
==============

This component is used to display a support-centric area. Top portion contains randomly rotating photos of our Jetpack happiness engineers, and links for users to find help they may need. Bottom portion contains links that allow users to add a review and follows us on popular social media networks.

#### How to use:

```js

var Footer = require( 'components/support-card' )

    return (
        <SupportCard />
    );
}

}
