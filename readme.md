### Development workflow

The javascript and CSS components of this plugin's admin interface need to be built in order to get the runtime bundle (`_inc/build/admin.js`)

**Recommended Dependencies**

Recommended environment:
- Node 6.x
- npm 3.8.x

If you're having trouble installing 6.x, [nvm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) is a nice tool for node version management :)

**Start Development**

1. Make sure you have `git`, `node`, and `npm` installed and a working WordPress installation.
2. Clone this repository locally inside your `/wp-content/plugins` directory.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack.git
	```

3. Make sure the Jetpack plugin is active and run

	```
	npm run build
	```

	This will install npm dependencies and then build the files.

4. Open `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=jetpack` in your browser.

#### Production build

The production build will generate minified files without duplicated code (resulting from dependencies) and also will generate the matching sourcemap files and language files.

```
npm run build-production
```

#### Development build

The development build will create a build without minifying or deduping code.

```
npm run build
```

#### Development build with changes monitoring (watch)

Running `npm run watch` instead of `npm run build` will build all the code and continuously watch the front-end JS and CSS/Sass for changes and rebuild accordingly.

**Before running `npm run watch` you may need to `npm install` the npm dependencies first if you didn't do it already**.

Clone this repository inside your Plugins directory.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Automattic/jetpack.git
$ cd jetpack
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
```

#### Unit-testing the JS Admin Page

You can run [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) based tests for the Admin Page source code with `npm run test-client`

Standing on your jetpack directory, run

```
$ npm install
$ npm run test-client
```
