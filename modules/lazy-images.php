/**
 * This module relies heavily upon the Lazy Load plugin which was worked on by
 * Mohammad Jangda (batmoo), the WordPress.com VIP team, the TechCrunch 2011
 * redesign team, and Jake Goldman of 10up LLC.
 *
 * The JavaScript has been updated to rely on InterSection observer instead of
 * jQuery Sonar. Many thanks to Dean Hume (deanhume) and his example:
