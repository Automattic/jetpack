# Customization

A guide to customizing the behavior of Base UI components.

## Base UI events

Change events such as `onOpenChange`, `onValueChange`, and `onPressedChange` are custom to Base UI.
They can be emitted by various different DOM events, effects, or even during rendering.

```js title="Base UI event signatures"
onOpenChange: (open, eventDetails) => void
onValueChange: (value, eventDetails) => void
onPressedChange: (pressed, eventDetails) => void
```

The `eventDetails` property is passed as a second argument to Base UI event handlers.
This enables the event to be customized, and also allows you to conditionally run side effects based on the reason or DOM event that caused the change.

```tsx title="eventDetails object"
interface BaseUIChangeEventDetails {
  reason: string;
  event: Event;
  cancel: () => void;
  allowPropagation: () => void;
  isCanceled: boolean;
  isPropagationAllowed: boolean;
}
```

- `reason` is used to determine why the change event occurred, which can be useful to conditionally run certain side effects.
  Most IDEs show the possible string values after typing `reason === '`.
- `event` is the native DOM event that caused the change.
- `cancel` stops the component from changing its internal state.
- `allowPropagation` allows the DOM event to propagate in cases where Base UI stops the propagation.
- `isCanceled` indicates whether the change event has been canceled.
- `isPropagationAllowed` indicates whether the DOM event is allowed to propagate.

### Canceling a Base UI event

An event can be canceled with the `cancel()` method on `eventDetails`:

```tsx title="Prevent a tooltip from closing when pressing the trigger"
<Tooltip.Root
  onOpenChange={(open, eventDetails) => {
    if (eventDetails.reason === 'trigger-press') {
      // Stop the open change (false) from happening.
      eventDetails.cancel(); // @highlight-text "cancel"
    }
  }}
>
  ...
</Tooltip.Root>
```

This lets you leave the component uncontrolled as its internal state is prevented from updating.
This is an alternative to controlling the component with external state and guarding the state updates conditionally.

### Allowing propagation of the DOM event

In most components, pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key stops the propagation of the event so parent popups don't close simultaneously.
This can also be customized with the `allowPropagation()` method:

```tsx title="Allowing propagation of the event"
<Tooltip.Root
  onOpenChange={(open, eventDetails) => {
    if (eventDetails.reason === 'escape-key') {
      // Allow the DOM event to propagate.
      eventDetails.allowPropagation(); // @highlight-text "allowPropagation"
    }
  }}
>
  ...
</Tooltip.Root>
```

## Preventing Base UI from handling a React event

To prevent Base UI from handling a React event like `onClick`, you can use the `preventBaseUIHandler()` method on the event object:

```tsx title="Prevent Base UI's default behavior"
<NumberField.Input
  onPaste={(event) => {
    event.preventBaseUIHandler();
  }}
/>
```

This should be used as an escape hatch in cases where there isn't a prop yet to customize the behavior.
In various cases, native events are used instead of React events, so this method has no effect.

## Controlling components with state

Change event handlers enable a component to be controlled with your own external state.

Components are uncontrolled by default, meaning that they manage their own state internally.

```tsx title="Uncontrolled dialog"
<Dialog.Root>
  <Dialog.Trigger /> {/* Opens the dialog when clicked. */}
</Dialog.Root>
```

A component can be made controlled by passing external state to a prop, such as `open` or `value`, and the state's setter to its corresponding change handler, such as `onOpenChange` or `onValueChange`.

For instance, you can open [Dialog](/react/components/dialog.md) after a timeout, without a trigger:

```tsx title="Controlled dialog"
const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

React.useEffect(() => {
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    setOpen(true);
  }, 1000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
}, []);

return (
  <Dialog.Root open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
    No trigger is needed in this case.
  </Dialog.Root>
);
```

This also allows you to read the state of the component outside of the root component.
