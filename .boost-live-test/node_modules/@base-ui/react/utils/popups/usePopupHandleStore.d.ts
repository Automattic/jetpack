/**
 * Reads the store currently exposed by a popup handle and subscribes to store-pointer changes.
 * Detached triggers use this to follow a handle as a root attaches or detaches: while no root is
 * attached, the handle exposes its fallback store; once a root attaches, subscribers re-render and
 * read from the live root store.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when no handle is provided so callers can fall back to their root context.
 *
 * @param handle The popup handle to read from, or `undefined` when the trigger is not handle-bound.
