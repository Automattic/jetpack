  (#3205) by @mj12albert

### Scroll Area

- **Breaking change:** Improve CSS vars performance.<br />

  (#3156) by @atomiks

### Slider

- **Breaking change:** Add `thumbCollisionBehavior` prop.<br />
  In range sliders, moving a thumb with a pointer will now push other thumbs it collides with to avoid blocking drag movements by default (the default value is `push`).<br />
  The value `swap` was also added, which allows thumbs to be dragged past each other when they collide.<br />
  Lastly, the value `none` is the same as the previous behavior, where thumbs can't be dragged past one another.<br />
  Keyboard interactions always use `none` behavior.
  (#2856) by @atomiks

    (#3024) by @atomiks

  If you need your Tabs to activate on focus, be sure to add `activateOnFocus` prop.

_Oct 1, 2025_

  (#2764) by @LukasTy

As a result, if you want the scroll arrows to be hidden in this mode like before, change the styles to default to `display: none` on `.ScrollArrow`, and `display: block` when `[data-side="none"]`. (#2596) by @atomiks

- Add `thumbAlignment` prop (#2540) by @mj12albert

### Switch

- Fix duplicate `name` attribute (#2763) by @mj12albert

### Toast

- **Breaking change:** Support variable height stacking.
  Toasts that have varying heights no longer force a `data-expanded` expanded state on the viewport. CSS should be amended to ensure larger toasts don't overflow a small toast stacked at the front. See this [diff](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/pull/2742/files#diff-e378460dafb74fe0c90ef960ad0ef1c38d68d74b63815520bb437f9041361917) for new styles, along with general improvements to stacking styles.

## v1.0.0-beta.3

_Sep 3, 2025_

### General changes

- **Breaking change:** Base UI event details.
  Custom event callbacks provide BaseUIEventDetails object as their second parameter.
  This object contains the source event, reason and methods to customize the behavior (where applicable).
  For example, `onOpenChange(open, event, reason)` becomes `onOpenChange(open, eventDetails)`, where `eventDetails` contains `event` and `reason` properties.

  ```diff
  -onOpenChange: (open, event, reason) => {
  +onOpenChange: (open, eventDetails) => {
  - if (reason === 'escape-key') {
  +  if (eventDetails.reason === 'escape-key') {
       // ...
     }
   }
  ```

  (#2382) by @atomiks

### Alert Dialog

- **Breaking change:** Support `initialFocus` and `finalFocus` functions.
  The `initialFocus` and `finalFocus` props can be functions that return DOM elements to focus.

- Prevent defaultValue reset on focus for uncontrolled inputs (#2543) by @ingokpp
- Allow `onValueChange` to fire when `defaultValue`/`value` are not set (#2600) by @atomiks

### Input

- Allow `onValueChange` to fire when `defaultValue`/`value` are not set (#2600) by @atomiks

### Menu

- **Breaking change:** Fix `closeParentOnEsc` default value.
  The default value of `closeParentOnEsc` in Menu.SubmenuRoot is now false.
  When the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is pressed in a Submenu, the Submenu closes, and the focus correctly moves to the SubmenuTrigger.
  (#2493) by @seongminn
- **Breaking change:** Support `initialFocus` and `finalFocus` functions.
  The `initialFocus` and `finalFocus` props can be functions that return DOM elements to focus.
  This is a new feature for `finalFocus` and a breaking change for `initialFocus` as the element must be returned directly (not as a ref).

### Navigation Menu

  `NavigationMenu.List` renders `<ul>` and `NavigationMenu.Item` renders `<li>` by default.
  (#2526) by @atomiks
- Unshare `AbortController` instance (#2441) by @tomokinat
- Close on link click by default (#2535) by @atomiks

### Number Field

- Fix duplicate `onValueChange` calls (#2591) by @atomiks

### Popover

- **Breaking change:** Support `initialFocus` and `finalFocus` functions.
  The `initialFocus` and `finalFocus` props can be functions that return DOM elements to focus.
  This is a new feature for `finalFocus` and a breaking change for `initialFocus` as the element must be returned directly (not as a ref).

- Fix scroll arrows not propagating scroll fully to start/end of list (#2523) by @atomiks
- Fix `limitShift` offset based on arrow size (#2571) by @atomiks

### Slider

- **Breaking change:** Instead of the thumb div, the `input type="range"` element receives focus. Focus styles that were targeting the thumb, should be updated.
  For example `.Thumb:focus-visible` should be replaced with `.Thumb:has(:focus-visible)`.
  The `tabIndex` prop is moved from Root to Thumb where it gets forwarded to the input.
  The thumb's `render` prop no longer contains the third `inputProps` argument; the input element is instead merged with children.

- Add `collisionAvoidance` prop (#1849) by @atomiks

### useRender

- **Breaking change:** Performance/refactor: `useRender`. An object with a `renderElement` property is no longer returned; instead, the hook returns the element directly (`const element = useRender(...)`). The `refs` option was also renamed to `ref`.
  (#1934) by @romgrk
