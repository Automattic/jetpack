# Jetpack AI Client

 JavaScript client for consuming Jetpack AI services. This client provides functionalities to fetch images and request completions from the Jetpack AI API as well as managing authentication tokens for the Jetpack AI streaming completion API.

## Installation

To install the Jetpack AI Client, clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies with npm:

```
npm install @automattic/jetpack-ai-client
```

## Usage

### Requesting a Completion from the Jetpack AI API

You can request a completion from the Jetpack AI API using the `requestCompletion` function. This function takes a prompt and optionally a post ID as parameters and returns an instance of `SuggestionsEventSource`.

```
import { requestCompletion } from 'jetpack-ai-client';

// postId is the post where the request is being triggered
// It's only used for loggin purposes and can be omitted.
const postId = 123;
const eventSource = requestCompletion( 'A haiku', postId ))

eventSource.addEventListener('done', event => {
  console.log( "Full completion", event.detail );
} );

eventSource.addEventListener('suggestion', event => {
  console.log( "Received so far", event.detail );
} );
```

### Requesting Images from the Jetpack AI API

You can fetch images from Jetpack AI using the `requestImages` function. This function takes a prompt and a post ID as parameters and returns a promise that resolves to an array of base64 encoded images.

```
import { requestImages } from 'jetpack-ai-client';

requestImages( 'a flower', postId )
  .then( images => {
    document.getElementById("imgid").src= image[0]
  } )
  .catch( error => {
    // Handle the error
  } );
```

### Using the SuggestionsEventSource Class

The `SuggestionsEventSource` class is a wrapper around `EventSource` that emits events for each chunk of data received, when the stream is closed, and when a full suggestion has been received.

You shouldn't need to instantiate this class. You get one of these by calling `requestCompletion()`.

```
import { requestCompletion } from 'jetpack-ai-client';

const eventSource = new SuggestionsEventSource( url );

eventSource.addEventListener( 'done', event => {
  console.log( "Full completion", event.detail );
} );

eventSource.addEventListener( 'suggestion', event => {
  console.log( "Received so far", event.detail );
} );
```

### Requesting a Token from the Jetpack Site

You can request a token from the Jetpack site using the `requestCompletionAuthToken` function. This function returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the token and the blogId.

This function behaves properly whether it's called from a Jetpack environment or a WordPress.com one.

```
import { requestCompletionAuthToken } from 'jetpack-ai-client';

requestCompletionAuthToken()
  .then(tokenData => {
    // Do something with the token data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle the error
  });
```
