Significance: minor
Type: added

Support for more complex MDN data:
* Multiple support statements are now all checked. Previously only the first (most recent) was, which may have missed cases where support was backported.
* `version_removed` is now checked.
* Ranged versions (â‰¤) are now handled.
* `prefix`, `alternative_name`, and `flags` now indicate (possible) lack of support.
