## [2.1.0] - 2024-02-07
### Added
- All versions indicated by browserslist are now checked, not just the lowest. Added `getAllBrowsers` function to support this. [#31658]
- Support for more complex MDN data:
  * Multiple support statements are now all checked. Previously only the first (most recent) was, which may have missed cases where support was backported.
  * `version_removed` is now checked.
  * Ranged versions (â‰¤) are now handled.
  * `prefix`, `alternative_name`, and `flags` now indicate (possible) lack of support. [#31658]

### Changed
- Updated package dependencies.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `getBrowsers` function in favor of the new `getAllBrowsers`. [#31658]

### Fixed
- Apparently MDN data considers "preview" a version, but didn't think that worth documenting. Handle it. [#31816]
