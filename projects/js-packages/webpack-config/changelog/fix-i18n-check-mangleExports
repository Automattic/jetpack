Significance: major
Type: changed

Disable `optimization.mangleExports` in production mode in favor of the `I18nSafeMangleExportsPlugin` from `@automattic/i18n-check-webpack-plugin`. This is technically a breaking change, as if someone had been disabling `mangleExports` for other reasons this will effectively re-enable it.
