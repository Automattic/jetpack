# Storybook

Storybook is an open-source tool that provides a sandbox to develop and visualize components in isolation. See the [Storybook site](https://storybook.js.org/) for more information about the tool.

This is a modified version of the storybook used by [The Gutenberg project](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/storybook).

Run locally in your development environment running: `npm run storybook:dev` from this directory.
