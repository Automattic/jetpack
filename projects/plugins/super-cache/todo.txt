## WP Super Cache - Top Level Menu

This keeps track of what is left to do before this is ready to send to PR

---- Known issues left to fix ---
* Debug settings do not seem to save anymore
* Plugins list does not seem to populate
* Restore default configuration not working from Advanced tab.

* CSS Stick footer to the bottom of the page on shorter pages
* Delete Cache button from "Easy" sub menu page does not work
  - There's an admin bar delete cache button so we could just remove it from "Easy".
-------------------------------------

Final checks:-
* Final check through all settings to make sure they work
* REMOVE old Settings -> WP Super Cache page

Janitorial / Going to be hellish.
* Put strings through translation esc_e_html etc. There's some jQuery (banner install button text)
* PHPCS loads of errors coming up. Going to `no-verify` just to get this PR in the cloud.

Change log:-
 - BRANCHED from Mark's modal PR not TRUNK. It wouldn't let me merge Mark's into trunk (failing tests)

 - registered menu and sub menus for the settings tabs from Super Cache
 - tracked through all the code globals and a single admin url to make tabs work
   - this was quite hellish. I started so might as well see it through still some issues
   - found an unusual edge case where turning caching ON and OFF via "easy" mode woudld change advanded settings too.
   - No major design changes to the sub-menus
     - Added a top menu item (logo)
     - Added a "Settings Saved" 

 - since a menu and sub menus it opens the door for a landing page 
   - quickly built in the design landing page
   - built CSS for desktop and mobile for new page
   - added an AJAX on / off save routine for caching JUST FOR caching
   - made a dynamic formatted pages cached counter.
   - added another install Boost Modal installing and activating via AJAX
   - The current way to save settings was hooked to `admin_init` 
     - Oddly the "easy" action from the form, then reset the action.

- Firmed up Mark's Boost banner cta to install and activate using AJAX
  - Refined it so it shows different messages depending on the status of Boost (none, installed but not active, active).

- Redirected the activation hook notice to send to the landing page
  - this way it's not as massive in your face boost advert this way.

- Renamed "Contents" to "Cached Files"
  - Can delete the cache from here, so in theory the "Delte Cache" from "Easy" we can remove.
