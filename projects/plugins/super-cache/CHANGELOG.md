* Editors can delete single cached files from the Toolbar now.
* Fixed the cached page counter on the settings page.
* Some sites that updated to 1.0 experienced too much garbage collection. There are still stragglers out there who haven't upgraded but that's fixed now!
* Supercached mobile files are now used as there was a tiny little typo that needed fixing.
* If your site is in a directory and you saw problems updating a page then that should be fixed now.
* The deactivate hook has been changed so your configuration isn.t hosed when you upgrade. Unfortunately this will only happen after you do this upgrade.
* Some sites use custom cookies with the LOGGED_IN_COOKIE constant. Added support for that.
