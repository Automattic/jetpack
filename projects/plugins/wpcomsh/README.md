# AT Pressable disable WPCom third-party premium theme editing

Business users are entitled for all the WPCom premium themes free of charge. After moving their sites to Pressable
 with AT, they can still select and use a WPCom premium theme. However, "due to our agreement with our third-party
 theme sellers on dotcom, we are allowed to host, but not distribute non-a8c premium themes." 
 ([link](http://wp.me/p58i-4kZ)).

This MU plugin disables theme editing (wp-admin -> Appearance -> Editor ) for such themes.
