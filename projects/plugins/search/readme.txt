If you are using the Jetpack Search free option, and you have more than 5000 records (posts, pages, etc. ) on your site, or more than 500 search requests per month, we will ask you to upgrade to a paid subscription at the appropriate tier at your next renewal period. If your usage is above the threshold for three months or more, we will disable the plan, and your site visitors will see the default WordPress search experience instead. Note that we base the number of requests on the median of the past three months, so an unusual spike in search traffic will not automatically force you into the next tier.
