== Description ==

== TOTAL SITE SECURITY FROM WORDPRESS EXPERTS ==

Jetpack Protect is a free and essential WordPress security plugin that scans your site and warns you about vulnerabilities, keeping your site one step ahead of security threats. It’s easy to use; setup requires just a few clicks!

By upgrading Protect, you also unlock malware scanning with one-click fixes for most issues and instant notifications when threats are detected. Our automated Web Application Firewall (WAF) also protects your site from bad actors around the clock.

Jetpack Protect is created by WordPress experts; our parent company Automattic is behind Jetpack, WordPress.com, WooCommerce, WPScan, and much more. There is no better company to understand the security needs of WordPress sites.

== WHAT DOES JETPACK PROTECT (FREE) CHECK FOR? ==

Jetpack Protect scans your site on a daily basis and warns you about:
- The version of WordPress installed, and any associated vulnerabilities
- What plugins are installed, and any related vulnerabilities
- What themes are installed, and any associated vulnerabilities

= What are vulnerabilities? Why do I need to scan my site regularly? =
Site vulnerabilities are flaws in a website's code that weaken the site's overall security. These can be introduced to a site in various ways, in most cases unintentionally.

Some of the ways vulnerabilities can be introduced to a site are:
- Poorly written site code
- Plugin and theme bugs
- WordPress version bugs
- System misconfigurations

If a bad actor detects a vulnerability on your site, they can exploit it to access sensitive information, update your site, and more to damage your business or brand.

That’s why it’s essential to use a reputable and reliable vulnerability & malware site scanner like Jetpack Protect to safeguard your site.

= Can I use Jetpack Scan to fix a site that is already infected? =

Jetpack Protect (Scan) detects and prevents attacks, but is not designed to fully clean up sites infected before it was active. If your site has malware, take immediate action to clean it up and remove the malicious code.

To clean up your site, we suggest using a malware removal tool, or if possible restore from a backup taken before the infection. We recommend using Jetpack VaultPress Backup in conjunction with Jetpack Scan to secure your website.

== UPGRADE PROTECT TO REMOVE MALWARE IN ONE CLICK AND BE PROTECTED BY OUR WAF ==
By upgrading Protect, you unlock total site security from WordPress experts:
- Automated daily malware scanning in addition to vulnerability checks
- One-click fixes for most issues
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) with automatic rule updates
- Instant email notifications when threats are detected
- Priority support from WordPress experts

= What is malware? Why do I need to protect against it? =
Malware is malicious code or software that has been created by bad actors to disrupt, damage, or gain access to your site. There are many ways that malware can get onto your WordPress site. The most common method is through attackers using vulnerable plugins or themes to install malware.

Similar to the vulnerabilities listed above, bad actors can use malware to capture sensitive information, damage your site, and harm your business or brand.

Jetpack Protect instantly notifies you of any threats detected, with one-click fixes for most issues.

= What is a Web Application Firewall (WAF)? =
A web application firewall blocks traffic and malicious requests to your site from known bad actors.

As threats are detected, new rules are added to Jetpack Protect’s firewall, which provides around-the-clock protection for your WordPress site.

== OVER 38,393 REGISTERED VULNERABILITIES IN OUR DATABASE ==

WordPress security is something that evolves over time. Jetpack Protect leverages the extensive database of WPScan, an Automattic brand. All vulnerabilities are entered into our database by dedicated WordPress security professionals and updated constantly as new information becomes available.

== JETPACK PROTECT IS EASY TO SETUP AND USE ==

There’s nothing to configure – the setup process is as easy as:
1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Set up it with one click.

After you activate the plugin, Jetpack Protect will run daily automatic malware scans on your WordPress site and update you on vulnerabilities associated with your installed plugins, themes, and WordPress core.

WPScan is an enterprise vulnerability scanning solution. It is not recommended for small to medium-sized businesses. If you are an enterprise company looking for custom WordPress site protection solutions, please visit: https://wpscan.com/
