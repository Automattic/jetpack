== FAQ ==

= How does Jetpack Protect help your WordPress Site security? =

Protect is a free WordPress security and malware scanner plugin that scans your site and lets you know possible malware and security threats on your installed plugins, themes, and core files.

Jetpack Protect does not require the Jetpack plugin to run and secure your site.

= What are the differences between Jetpack Protect, Jetpack Scan, and WPScan plugins? =

Jetpack Protect and WPScans are standalone plugins that don‚Äôt need additional plugins to run, while Jetpack Scan needs the [Jetpack plugin](https://jetpack.com/) to work.

Jetpack Protect is a free plugin, and WPScan has free and paid options. On the other hand, Jetpack Scan is a paid plugin that you can purchase with a 14-day money-back guarantee. As with other paid Jetpack plugins, Scan users also have access to our [priority support](https://jetpack.com/features/security/expert-priority-support/).

= Why do I need WordPress security and malware scan? =
