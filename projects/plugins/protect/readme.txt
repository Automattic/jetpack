Jetpack Protect - Free malware scan and WordPress site security

== Description ==

Jetpack Protect is a free security plugin for WordPress that scans your site and warns you about vulnerabilities,
keeping your site one step ahead of security threats and malware.

== What does Jetpack Protect check for? ==

Jetpack Protect scans your site on a daily basis and warns you about:

- The version of WordPress installed, and any associated vulnerabilities
- What plugins are installed and any related vulnerabilities
- What themes are installed and any associated vulnerabilities

== Over 25,000 registered malware and vulnerabilities in our database ==

WordPress security is something that evolves over time. Jetpack Protect leverages the extensive database of WPScan, an
Automattic brand. All vulnerabilities and malwares are entered into our database by dedicated WordPress security
professionals and updated constantly as new information becomes available.

== Easy to setup and use ==

There‚Äôs nothing to configure ‚Äì the setup process is as easy as:
1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Set up it with one click.

After you activate the plugin, Jetpack Protect will run daily automatic malware scans on your WordPress site and update
you on vulnerabilities associated with your installed plugins, themes, and WordPress core.

== WITH üíö BY JETPACK ==

This is just the start!

We are working hard to bring more features and improvements to Jetpack Protect. Let us know your thoughts and ideas!

== FAQ ==

= How does Jetpack Protect help your WordPress Site security? =

Protect is a free WordPress security and malware scanner plugin that scans your site and lets you know possible malware
and security threats on your installed plugins, themes, and core files.

= Does this plugin require the Jetpack plugin to work? =

Jetpack Protect does not require the Jetpack plugin to run and secure your site.

= What are the differences between Jetpack Protect, Jetpack Scan, and WPScan plugins? =

Jetpack Protect and Scan do not have any limit on the number of plugins and themes you can scan. WPScan has a daily cap
based on your API usage.

For now, in Jetpack Protect, you can track your scan results only through the plugin‚Äôs dashboard. Jetpack Scan and
WPScan have additional notifications such as email.

Jetpack Protect runs daily automated scans. Jetpack Scan and WPScan provide on-demand scan options on top of automatic
scans.

Jetpack Scan has one-click fixers for most vulnerabilities. Protect does not have any fixers at this time, but it
provides ‚Äúhow-to-fix‚Äù guides so that you can fix vulnerabilities manually.

Jetpack Protect and WPScans are standalone plugins that don‚Äôt need additional plugins to run, while Jetpack Scan needs
the [Jetpack plugin](https://jetpack.com/) to work.

Jetpack Protect is a free plugin, and WPScan has free and paid options. On the other hand, Jetpack Scan is a paid plugin
that you can purchase with a 14-day money-back guarantee. As with other paid Jetpack plugins, Scan users also have
access to our [priority support](https://jetpack.com/features/security/expert-priority-support/).

= How will I know if Jetpack Protect has found WordPress security vulnerabilities and malware? =

You can visit Jetpack Protect dashboard in your WordPress admin panel to see the security threats and malware found by
the integrated malware scanner.

= What do I do if Jetpack Protect finds a security threat? =

When the malware scanner finds a security threat, you can view the recommended actions on the Jetpack Protect dashboard
to secure your sites.

= Can I set the time of the daily security scan? =

It is not possible to set a time for the automated daily scans run by the integrated malware scanner.

= Why do I need WordPress security and malware scan? =

A hacked WordPress site can cause serious damage to your business revenue and reputation. Jetpack Protect scans your
site and lets you know possible malware and security threats on your installed plugins, themes, and core files.

= Where can I learn more about WordPress security and malware threats? =
