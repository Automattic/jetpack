# Jetpack Protect

Jetpack Protect plugin


**If you are not planning on developing with Jetpack Boost, you should install Jetpack Boost from pre-built sources.** Details on that may be found [on this page](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack-protect-production).

## Developing

Jetpack Protect is currently under development and we have 2 constants that let us work in the plugin while we are still building the service in WPCOM.

`JETPACK_PROTECT_DEV__BYPASS_CACHE` - will ignore the cached results and will always request fresh data from WPCOM servers.

`JETPACK_PROTECT_DEV__API_RESPONSE_TYPE` - will let you ask WPCOM servers to send a specific response to your requests:

Since the service is still under development, WPCOM is still responding with sample, hardcoded, data. You can choose which response type you want to get by passing one of the following parameters:

* complete_green: Response will include all plugins and zero vulnerabitlies
* incomplete_green: Response will miss one plugin and have zero vulnerabilities
* complete: Response will include all plugins and 2 of them will have vulnerabilities
* incomplete: Response will miss one plugin and 2 of them will have vulnerabilities
* empty: Response as if the first check was not performed yet
* error: Response as if there was an error checking vulnerabilities

Example:

```
define( 'JETPACK_PROTECT_DEV__BYPASS_CACHE', true );
define( 'JETPACK_PROTECT_DEV__API_RESPONSE_TYPE', 'complete' );
```

`JETPACK_PROTECT_DEV__API_CORE_VULS` - will let you ask WPCOM servers to respond with found vulnerabilities for WordPress core. The value should be an integer with the number of vulnerabilities you want to get. Default is zero.

### Troubleshooting

Jetpack Protect and the dev API endpoint on WPCOM relies on Sync. Protect needs to send the list of installed themes and plugins to our servers so we know what to check for.

Sometimes in our dev environment we might run into situations where information is not synced immediately (because of plugin dance, etc).

If you run in a situation where you are only getting empty responses from our testing endpoint, even though you have many plugins and themes installed and chose the right `response_type` in the constants described above, try the following:

* Delete this transient: `wp transient delete jetpack_sync_callables_await`
* Install or uninstall a plugin and/or a theme to make sure the list changes
