<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A paragraph summary, such as: Works to website at clientsdomain.com, including a re-design with three client-feedback stages, and translation into French.</p>
<h2>Strategic Goals</h2>
<p>##BIZ-NAME##’s experience is your secret advantage. We’re super aware of what’s necessary to present a strong online presence in 2017. We’ve been doing this for more than a decade, and the number one reason our clients come back time and time again is that we know that your strategic goals are our strategic goals.</p>
<p>At ##CUSTOMERNAME##, you’ve told us that you need to refine your online experience, and&nbsp;to improve engagement. We will&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;on these goals, and have&nbsp;applied our years of practical experience, and broken these down into deliverables, each marking a stage of completion where you can feedback. We’ve also analysed your requests and come up with some concrete markers which we can use to ensure we over deliver!:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Refine online experience @ clientsdomain.com
        <ul>
            <li>Marker: User Experience feedback score before and after work, with a 30% improvement overall</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Improve engagement.
        <ul>
            <li>Marker: Bail-rate reduced by 50%</li>

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We recommend that you write these yourself, as these are your legal protection in any dispute with your client. It is worth firming up dates, and client components of your “deliverables” here – e.g. if they need to send you a logo before you can finish stage 1, write a clause which says “we need a high-res logo by date X, otherwise the stage will be classed as complete”.</p>
