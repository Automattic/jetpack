<p>We've built a few extras for Jetpack CRM, but they're mostly offering functionality outside the core CRM, so we've seperated them into individual "extensions". These all have some supercharging effect on your CRM, but none are essential.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any limits to contact or invoice counts in Jetpack CRM? =

There are absolutely no limits in Jetpack CRM, apart from the usual ones applied by your host (database size etc.), you can create as many clients or invoices as you'd like!

= Is Jetpack CRM really free? =

Totally. The core is a solid, useful, Customer Relationship Manager right out of the box. You don't need anything else to get started managing your leads, and customers. We do build extensions, (because we need them), but they're not at all essential. Further, they're cheap in comparison to the pay-per-month CRM options.

= Can I develop on top of Jetpack CRM? =

Of course. Please reach out to us via the in-plugin feedback page if you want to, we'll help you get started, or check out our [Developer resources](https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/developer-ready/).

= What is next on the CRM roadmap? =

We haven't published our roadmap since v3, but we may do in the future. You can vote on future extensions on our [Coming Soon](https://jetpackcrm.com/coming-soon/) page.

= Where can I see the CRM extensions? =

You can see all the CRM power-ups here: https://jetpackcrm.com/extensions/

= Is there a contact search feature on Jetpack CRM? =

Yes, Jetpack CRM comes with a search feature that allows you to run a customer search, contact search, and then act on it, letting you easily manage contacts. There’s also search for transactions, quotes, invoices, companys, lead forms, and tasks.

= Why host your own CRM in WordPress? =

Data privacy, control, extensibility. GDPR compliance. You're probably already paying for hosting too, so you'll save there. SaaS has its place, but there's so much value in hosting your own (e.g. for GDPR rules you need to know where your contacts data is kept)!

= How do I get my existing contacts into Jetpack CRM? =

The free core is fully integrated with WooCommerce using the built-in WooSync module. It also has a basic CSV Importer which works well and allows you to import contacts and import customer data. You can also use our paid extensions for additional features: CSV Importer Pro, PayPal Sync, or Stripe Sync - these automatically pull up all your contact data (including transactions) and then keep it up to date for you!

= If I’ve been using another CRM, can I import all my data into Jetpack CRM? =

Most CRM providers allow you to export your contact data in CSV format, which can then be used to upload into Jetpack CRM. The CSV Importer Pro extension can then be used to import contacts and customer data. CRM is a very broad landscape, so each CRM may have different ways of storing data. See our [CRM Knowledgebase](https://kb.jetpackcrm.com) for more information, or ask in the forums!

= Do you have a B2B mode? =

Yes, Jetpack CRM has a [Business to Business mode](https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/b2b-mode/). Enabling the B2B CRM Extension adds a "Companies" layer, which lets you have contacts under a company.

= How does B2B mode (Companies) work in Jetpack CRM? =

<p>Jetpack CRM allows you to manage contacts at companies from within the CRM. This adds a hierarchy to your CRM, letting you add a contact to a company using our contact manager. Currently you can bill (invoice) companies or contacts respectively, but in the future we want to make this much more integrated.</p>
<p>For now, this works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Make a company (e.g. "Davidsons Ltd.")</li>
<li>Make a contact, e.g. "Dave Davidson".</li></ol>

<p>... as part of making or editing this new contact you will be able to assign them to the company made in step 1.</p>

<p>Invoices and transactions can then be assigned to either "Davidsons Ltd." or "Dave Davidson" directly.</p>

= Does Jetpack CRM work as an ecommerce plugin? =

Jetpack CRM allows you to create and manage <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/quotes">quotes</a>, <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/invoices/">invoices</a>, and <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/transactions">transactions</a> against contacts. While this setup may be used in some senses like an ecommerce platform, really the aim with Jetpack CRM is to effectively manage a contact list, including manually billing them (e.g. getting invoices paid online). This works well, via our <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/client-portal-2/">client portal</a>, but if you want a fuller ecommerce setup, we recommend using <a href="https://woocommerce.com" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a>, which we integrate with, (it's really great).

= Can I use this as a WooCommerce CRM? =

Yes, Jetpack CRM is actually ideal for using with WooCommerce. You can read more about [Jetpack as a WooCommerce CRM here](https://jetpackcrm.com/woocommerce/).

= Does Jetpack CRM work as a booking / recurring subscription plugin? =

<p>Bookings: While Jetpack CRM has a useful <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/tasks/">Task scheduler</a> which can help manage tasks against contacts, we do not have a pure booking layer. For this we recommend using <a href="https://woocommerce.com/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> and a WooCommerce bookings plugin, integrated into Jetpack CRM via <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/woocommerce/">WooSync</a>.</p>
<p>Recurring subscriptions: Much as above, you could create an invoice via Jetpack CRM, then make it recur via Stripe and have that synced into Jetpack CRM via <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/product/stripe-sync/">Stripe Sync</a>, but in this instance we'd recommend using <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/" target="_blank">WooCommerce subscriptions</a>.</p>

= Does Jetpack CRM include lead capture forms? =

Yes, Jetpack CRM allows you to easily capture leads using our [lead capture forms](https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/forms/). These could be added into posts, pages or widgets - when leads fill them out their information goes straight into the CRM.

= What are my options for lead generation forms? =

Jetpack CRM ships with its own form builder, which lets you insert forms into your posts and pages via shortcode forms or iframe forms. For users that need more advanced form features, we offer support for Jetpack Forms out of the box, and have integrations with Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms via paid CRM extensions.

= Can Jetpack CRM help me pay sales commissions? =

<p>We occasionally get asked if Jetpack CRM can help calculate and pay sales commissions. We do have some users who are using the CRM for this, but there are no direct features out of the box which will provide this functionality, these users are simply totting up the transactions assigned to contacts based on their 'owners' in Jetpack CRM, then paying these commissions manually. We may in future expand our reporting to offer something along the lines of a sales summary per agent.</p>

= How do I send email campaigns from Jetpack CRM? =

To send out email broadcasts such as newsletters or other email marketing you will need to purchase [Jetpack Mail Campaigns](https://jetpackcrm.com/mail-campaigns/), or a bundle which includes it. In short, it's worth paying for a quality mail sending plugin because it can make the difference between your newsletters being well received, or ending up in the spam box.

= What Automations and Workflows does Jetpack CRM support? =

Jetpack CRM has its own [Automations extension](https://jetpackcrm.com/product/automations/) which uses Triggers, Conditions, and Actions to automate workflows based on CRM events. This can be used in lead generation, email marketing, or internal business admin. If you have an idea for a workflow or automation you'd like to see, please do [submit it as a feature request](https://kb.jetpackcrm.com/submit-a-ticket/).

= What add-ons are available? =

<p>We have over 30 premium extensions available in our <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/extensions/">CRM extension store</a>. These are totally optional, but supercharge some aspects of the CRM, (e.g. StripeSync automatically pulls in your customer and transaction data from Stripe).</p><p>Most users tend to purchase bundles of extensions, which allows them to 'make their perfect CRM':<br /><br /><a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/extension-bundles/">View CRM Bundles</a></p>

= When do I need a license key? =

<p>You can now add your license key into your Jetpack CRM settings page (under 'CRM License'). This is only required if you wish to use paid extensions. To get started with premium CRM extensions, please visit our <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/extensions/">extension store</a>.</p><p>After you've purchased you'll be guided to your new license key and extension plugin download.</p>

= How do I purchase more than one license? =

We have many agencies using Jetpack CRM, so this is a common question.

To get stared please see our <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/extension-bundles/">bundles page</a> - if you're likely to need 10~ licenses, the best bet is to get started with the Reseller package. If you want to build up more slowly, please purchase the Entrepreneur bundle and let us know via a support ticket if you would like to add additional licenses to your account.

= What is the refund policy? =

We offer a full, no-hassle refund within 14 days. You can read more about that, and how to request a refund, <a href="https://jetpackcrm.com/refund-policy/" target="_blank">on this page</a>.
