Significance: major
Type: enhancement

Entire posts can now be restricted to either paid subscribers, or email subscribers. This will enable site owners to:
- reward their paying subscribers with secret Lasagna recipes
- create paid-only issues of their newsletters
- create incentives and landing pages to gain subscribers
- create paid courses, and pursue other subscriber-only models
- support themselves financially without sacrificing creative freedom
- buy literal jetpacks from all the money they make on their sites (outcome not guaranteed)
