Scheduled updates: Introduced a new body parameter `is_scheduled_update` to the `POST /sites/%s/plugins/%s` endpoint. When this endpoint is called with the `is_scheduled_update` parameter,  we validate the request and modify the auto-update plugins allowed list to include the ones in the scheduled updates option.
