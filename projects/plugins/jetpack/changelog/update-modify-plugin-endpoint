Scheduled updates: Introduced a new body parameter `scheduled_update` to the `POST /sites/%s/plugins/%s` endpoint.

When `POST /sites/%s/plugins/%s` endpoint is called with the `scheduled_update` parameter, we validate the request and modify the auto update plugins allowed list to include the ones in the scheduled updates option.
