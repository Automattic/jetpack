## Jetpack 14.0

### Before you start:

- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use the "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" WordPress plugins to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything of note you see.
- You may need to connect Jetpack to a WordPress.com account to test some features, find out how to do that [here](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/).
- Blocks in beta status require a small change for you to be able to test them. You can do either of the following:
  - Edit your `wp-config.php` file to include: `define( 'JETPACK_BLOCKS_VARIATION', 'beta' );`
  - Or add the following to something like a code snippet plugin: `add_filter( 'jetpack_blocks_variation', function () { return 'beta'; } );`
	- To test Breve further in the document please enable the feature with the following snippet: `add_filter( 'breve_enabled', '__return_true' );`
