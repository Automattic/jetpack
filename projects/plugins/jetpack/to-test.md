## Jetpack 12.2

### Before you start:

- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use the "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" WordPress plugins to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything of note you see.

### AI Assistant:
Jetpack 12.2 brings a new AI Assistant block. Given Automattic's current focus on AI, this should be tested.

### My Plan:
- Check all images are loading.
- "My Plan" card should no longer show on sites with a free plan but paid add-on features.

### Donation block:
Block is now available with free plans. Check that it works.

### Related Posts block:
Block can now have a header configured, and there's an author toggle.

### Jetpack Forms:
Jetpack Forms continues to improve with changes in this release. In particular,

- Make sure things continue to work as expected.
