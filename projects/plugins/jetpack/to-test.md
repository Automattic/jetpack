## Jetpack 14.0

### Before you start:

- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use the "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" WordPress plugins to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything of note you see.
- You may need to connect Jetpack to a WordPress.com account to test some features, find out how to do that [here](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/).
- Blocks in beta status require a small change for you to be able to test them. You can do either of the following:
  - Edit your `wp-config.php` file to include: `define( 'JETPACK_BLOCKS_VARIATION', 'beta' );`
  - Or add the following to something like a code snippet plugin: `add_filter( 'jetpack_blocks_variation', function () { return 'beta'; } );`
	- To test Breve further in the document please enable the feature with the following snippet: `add_filter( 'breve_enabled', '__return_true' );`

### AI Logo Generator

On top of the already available AI Logo generator, we've now added a styles dropdown to allow more control for the user without depending entirely on the provided prompt.

The logo generator is not available for free users, test with a plan or subscription. Also, it's currenlty available for a12s (and will soon be open to public), but if you need to test with another account and have access to a sandbox, you can add a filter to enable the styles on your 0-sandbox.php file: `add_filter( 'jetpack_ai_logo_style_selector_enabled', '__return_true' );`

- Load the editor and add a Logo block.
- On the network tab you should see a request to `ai-assistant-feature`
  - If using an a11n account (or focing the filter to `true`), the response should include `featuresControl['logo-generator'].styles` as a collection of style objects.
  - If NOT using an a11n account, the `styles` property should be an empty array.
```
{
  ...
  featuresControl: {
    'logo-generator': {
      enabled: true,
      styles: [ COLLECTION OF SYLES HERE ]
    }
  }
}
```
- Use the block's AI toolbar button to open the Logo generator modal, you should see a style dropdown on the top-right corner
- Feel free to play with the styles to achieve different results
- Confirm that using style "Auto" will try to guess the style based on the prompt (AI query request) and set the style prior to sending the image generation request
- If possible, try different combinations of plans and cases:
  - use `add_filter( 'jetpack_ai_tier_licensed_quantity', function() { return 0 | 100 | 1; } );` filter to mock free/tier100/unlimited plans
	- sandbox the API, but then don't connect to sandbox to mock a disconnected situation
