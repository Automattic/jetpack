### Before you start

- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything you see.

### My Jetpack

This release contains the first iteration of My Jetpack, the new dashboard for managing standalone Jetpack plugins on the site. There's a lot to test here!

For Jetpack, start on a free plan and go to Dashboard > Jetpack > My Dashboard. From there:

- Check the various links
- Attempt to activate features and install additional standalone plugins.
- Check styling on desktop and mobile.
- Make sure Conntion links work.


### Color, Spacing, and Alignment Options for Various Blocks

Color, spacing, and alignment options were added for the following blocks:

- Form 
- Mailchimp
- Podcast Player
- Related Posts

Color and spacing options were added for:

- Business Hours

Alignment options were also added to:

- Repeat Visitor blocks

We can check and make sure those new features work as expected by adding them to posts and block widget areas and playing around with color, spacing and alignment.

**Thank you for all your help!**
