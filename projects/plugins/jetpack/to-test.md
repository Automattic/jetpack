## Jetpack 13.1

### Before you start:

- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use the "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" WordPress plugins to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything of note you see.
- You may need to connect Jetpack to a WordPress.com account to test some features, find out how to do that [here](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/).

### Like Block 

The existing Like & Reblog button features are now available as a block. With the new Like block, users are be able to add the Like & Reblog features not just to posts and pages, but also to block templates and block patterns. You can give the new Like block a try by adding it from within the editor just like any other block. For testing purposes, consider trying:

- adding multiple Like blocks to a single page or post
- adding the Like block to a page template
- adding the Like block nested within other blocks (e.g., Group or Columns)
- creating a block pattern where the Like block is present
- testing with different site themes
- testing with different site languages
- testing both frontend and editor views
- test across different screen sizes

### Sharing Buttons Block

Similar to the Like block above, the existing Sharing Buttons feature is now available as a block. For testing purposes, consider trying:

- adding the Sharing Buttons block to a page template
- adding the Sharing Buttons block nested within other blocks (e.g., Group or Columns)
- creating a block pattern where the Sharing Buttons block is present
- testing both frontend and editor views
- test across different screen sizes
- with a block-based theme active, navigate to Jetpack > Setting > Sharing and test with the existing Sharing Buttons toggle setting & functionality
