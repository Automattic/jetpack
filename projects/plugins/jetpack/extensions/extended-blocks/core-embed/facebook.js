 * Re-enable the Facebook embed block variation by making it appear in the inserter
 * and its URL pattern parseable again.
 *
 * Relevant for Gutenberg >= 9.0, where the aforementioned block was deprecated*[0] because
 * they do not support the oEmbed changes that Facebook is going to implement on Oct. 24th, 2020,
 * and Core has currently no plans to support it.
 *
 * However, we do plan on keeping support for these embeds in Jetpack and WordPress.com by sending an
 * access token alongside the oEmbed API request.
 *
 * Our goal is for this go unnoticed by our end-users, as this is only an implementation detail.
 *

 * @param {object} settings - Block settings object.
 * @param {string} name - The block name
 * @returns {object} The settings for the given block with the patched variations.
