# Jetpack Block Editor Extensions

This directory contains the source code for extensions in the block editor,
also known as Gutenberg, [that was introduced in WordPress 5.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/).

## Extension Type

We define different types of block editor extensions:

### Blocks
Blocks are available in the editor itself.
Located in the `./blocks` folder.

### Extended blocks
Blocks, usually core blocks, extended by Jetpack plugin.
Located in the `./extended-blocks` folder.

### Plugins
Core Editor [plugins](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-plugins/),
registered by Jetpack to extend the application UI via [Slot&Fill](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/slotfills/) components.

## Extension Structure

Extensions in the `extensions/` folder loosely follow this structure:

```txt
.
├── blocks/
│   └── block-name/
│		├── editor.js                ← script loaded only in the editor
│		├── editor.scss              ← styles loaded only in the editor
│		├── view.js                  ← script loaded on the frontend
│		└── view.scss                ← styles loaded on the frontend
│
├── extended-blocks/
│   └── block-name/
│		├── index.js                 ← entry point to extend.
│		└── ...
│
├── plugins/
│   └── plugin-name/
│		├── index.js                 ← plugin registration
│		└── ...
│
└── store/
	└── store-name/
		├── index.js                 ← plugin definition
		└── ...
```

If your block depends on another block, place them all in extensions folder:

```txt
.
└── blocks/
	├── block-name/
	└── sub-blockname/
```

## Developing block editor extensions in Jetpack

### High-level overview of the development flow

1. Use the [Jetpack Docker environment](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/trunk/tools/docker/README.md#readme).
1. Start a new branch.
1. Use Jetpack-CLI command to scaffold a new block (see below). That block will be created in the `extensions/blocks` folder, and will be set as a Beta block by default.
1. Or modify existing extensions in the same folder.
1. Run `jetpack build plugins/jtepack` to compile your changes.
1. Now test your changes in your Docker environment's wp-admin.
1. Open a PR
1. Test your changes in all 3 environments available to you: your local development site, a WordPress.com Simple site, and a WoA site.
1. Once the code works well in all environments and your PR has been approved, you can merge it!
1. When your block is ready to be shipped, move your extensions' slug from beta to production array in `extensions/index.json`

### Beta Extensions

Generally, all new extensions should start out as a beta.

- Before you develop, remember to add your extension's slug to the beta array in `extensions/index.json`.
- In the `wp-config.php` for your Docker environment (`docker/wordpress/wp-config.php`) or in your custom mu-plugins file (`docker/mu-plugins/yourfile.php`), enable beta extensions with the following snippet: `define( 'JETPACK_BLOCKS_VARIATION', 'beta' );`
- When you use this constant, you'll get all blocks: Beta blocks, Experimental blocks, and Production blocks.
- You can also filter to specific extensions: `add_filter( 'jetpack_blocks_variation', function () { return 'beta'; } );`.
- In the WordPress.com environment, Automatticians will be able to see beta extensions with no further configuration.
- In a Jurassic Ninja site, you must go to Settings > Jetpack Constants, and enable the Beta blocks option there.
- Once you've successfully beta tested your new extension, you can open new PR to make your extension live!
- Simply move the extension's slug out of the beta array and into the production array in `extensions/index.json`.

### Experimental Extensions

We also offer an "experimental" state for extensions. Those extensions will be made available to anyone having the `JETPACK_BLOCKS_VARIATION` constant set to `experimental` in `wp-config.php`. When you use this constant, you'll get Experimental blocks as well as Production blocks.

Experimental extensions are usually considered ready for production, but are served only to sites requesting them. **All WordPress.com sites have access to experimental extensions**.

### Scaffolding blocks with WP-CLI

We have a command in WP-CLI that allows to scaffold Jetpack blocks. Its syntax is as follows:

`wp jetpack scaffold <type> <title> [--slug] [--description] [--keywords] [--variation]`

**Currently the only `type` is `block`.**

#### Options

- **title**: Block name, also used to create the slug. This parameter is required. If it's something like _Logo gallery_, the slug will be `logo-gallery`. It's also used to generate the class name when an external edit component is requested. Following this example, it would be `LogoGalleryEdit`.
- **--slug**: Specific slug to identify the block that overrides the one generated base don the title.
- **--description**: Allows to provide a text description of the block.
- **--keywords**: Provide up to three keywords separated by a comma so users when they search for a block in the editor.
- **--variation**: Allows to decide whether the block should be a production block, experimental, or beta. Defaults to Beta when arg not provided.

#### Files

All files will be created in a directory under `extensions/blocks/` named after the block title or a specific given slug. For a hypothetical **Jukebox** block, it will create the following files

- `extensions/blocks/jukebox/`
- `extensions/blocks/jukebox/jukebox.php`
- `extensions/blocks/jukebox/index.js`
- `extensions/blocks/jukebox/editor.js`
- `extensions/blocks/jukebox/editor.scss`
- `extensions/blocks/jukebox/edit.js`

Additionally, the slug of the new block will be added to the `beta` array in the file `extensions/index.json`.
Since it's added to the beta array, you need to load the beta blocks as explained above to be able to test this block.

#### Examples

`wp jetpack scaffold block "Cool Block"`

`wp jetpack scaffold block "Amazing Rock" --slug="good-music" --description="Rock the best music on your site"`

`wp jetpack scaffold block "Jukebox" --keywords="music, audio, media"`

`wp jetpack scaffold block "Jukebox" --variation="experimental"`

### Testing

Run `cd projects/plugins/jetpack && pnpm test-extensions [--watch]` to run tests written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/).

Note that adding [Jest snapshot tests](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) for block's `save` methods is problematic because many core packages relying on `window` that is not present when testing with Jest. See [prior exploration](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/30727).

#### Can I use Jurassic Ninja to test blocks?

Yes! Just like any other changes in Jetpack, also blocks work in Jurassic Ninja.

Simply add branch name to the URL: jurassic.ninja/create/?jetpack-beta&branches.jetpack=master or use other ninjastic features.

## Deploying extensions

### How do I merge extensions?

Jetpack has a strict release schedule, so it's important to keep this in mind when merging extensions. Be mindful of [code freezes and release dates](https://github.com/Automattic/Jetpack/milestones) for all 3 different environments where the plugin is deployed (WordPress.com Simple, WoA, and self-hosted).

Once a PR has been merged, it will be included in the next release on each platform. With that in mind, use the "Beta" state to iterate on your extensions and test them in all 3 environments, until you're ready to deploy them to production.

### How do I test on WordPress.com Simple?

- If you've opened a Pull Request, you can use the command appearing as a comment on your PR as soon as the Build step has completed. This will deploy your branch to WordPress.com Simple, and you'll be able to test it there.
- If you're still working on your changes locally, you can use the Jetpack CLI and its `rsync` command to deploy your changes to your WordPress.com sandbox and test them there. You can find more information about the Jetpack CLI [here](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/trunk/tools/cli/README.md#available-commands).

### How do I test on WoA sites?

- If you've opened a Pull Request, you can use [the Jetpack Beta plugin](https://jetpack.com/download-jetpack-beta/) to test your changes on any WoA site.
- If you're still working on your changes locally, you can use the Jetpack CLI and its `rsync` command to push your changes to your WoA dev blog. You can learn more about WoA dev blogs at p9o2xV-1r2-p2

## Paid blocks

Blocks can be restricted to specific paid plans in both WordPress.com and Jetpack. When registering a block using `Blocks::jetpack_register_block`, pass `plan_check => true` as a key in the second argument. When the block is registered we check the plan data to see if the user's plan supports this block. For example:

```php
use Automattic\Jetpack\Blocks;
function register_block() {
	Blocks::jetpack_register_block(
		BLOCK_NAME,
		array(
			'render_callback' => __NAMESPACE__ . '\load_assets',
			'plan_check'      => true,
		)
	);
}
```

This approach applies to both blocks and sidebar extensions.

Sometimes blocks are paid for WordPress.com users but free for Jetpack users. In these cases it is still necessary to add the block to the plan data for _both_ environments, for example:

```php
const PLAN_DATA = array(
	'free'     => array(
		'plans'    => array(
			'jetpack_free',
		),
		'supports' => array(
			'opentable',
			'calendly',
		),
	),
```

The plan data is found in the Packages plan for Jetpack (see the `Current_Plan` class), and an example of adding the features to WordPress.com plans is in D43206-code.

### Upgrades for Blocks
Paid blocks that aren't supported by a user's plan will still be registered for use in the block editor, but will not be displayed by default.

You can, however, use the following filter:

```php
add_filter( 'jetpack_block_editor_enable_upgrade_nudge', '__return_true' );
```

This will allow you to take advantage of those registered blocks. They will not be rendered to logged out visitors on the frontend of the site, but the block will be available in the block picker in the editor. When you add a paid block to a post, an `UpgradeNudge` component will display above the block in the editor and on the front end of the site to inform users that this is a paid block. If a paid block is nested within another paid block, only the parent block will display its upgrade nudge on the front end.

### Upgrades for Jetpack sidebar extensions

Unlike blocks, adding an extension for the Jetpack sidebar requires calling `registerJetpackPlugin` (a high level wrapper around Gutenberg's `registerPlugin`) to register the Plugin with Gutenberg.

This function [contains a conditional which checks whether the extension is available on the current plan](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/f76d346a180c65a45aaf8be5802ae03d0e8d3355/extensions/shared/register-jetpack-plugin.js#L19-L22) and if it is not then the Plugin is _not_ registered and will not be available in the Jetpack sidebar.

This means that for extensions which are gated by Plan, users who are _not_ on the appropriate plan will not know they are missing out on the extension.

Therefore, in a similar way to ["Upgrades for Blocks"](#upgrades-for-blocks) you may wish to provide a fallback experience (eg: an upgrade nudge) for users who are not on an appropriate plan.

To do this, you can check whether your extension is available on the current plan using the [`getJetpackExtensionAvailability` helper function](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/f76d346a180c65a45aaf8be5802ae03d0e8d3355/extensions/shared/get-jetpack-extension-availability.js) and if it is _not_ available then you can conditionally register a fallback extension _directly with Gutenberg_ by calling `registerPlugin`. This bypasses the availability checks and ensures your fallback experience is always rendered _if_ the user is not on an appropriate plan.

An example of this pattern is provided below:

```jsx
const extensionName = 'my-extension-name';

/*
 * Register the main "social-previews" extension if the feature is available
 * on the current plan.
 */
registerJetpackPlugin( extensionName, {
	render: () => <MyExtensionComponent />
} );

/*
 * If the social previews extension is not available on this plan (WP.com only)
 * then manually register a near identical Plugin which shows the upgrade nudge.
 */
const extensionAvailableOnPlan = getJetpackExtensionAvailability( 'social-previews' )?.available;

if ( ! extensionAvailableOnPlan ) {
	/*
	 * When registering directly we must manually prepend the 'jetpack-'
	 * prefix to the block slug and the `-fallback` suffix in order to
	 * identify it as the fallback extension.
	 */
	registerPlugin( `jetpack-${ extensionName }-fallback`, {
		render: <MyExtensionComponent isFallback={true} />
	} );
}
```

For a working example please see the [Social Previews extension](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/f76d346a180c65a45aaf8be5802ae03d0e8d3355/extensions/blocks/social-previews/editor.js):


### Terminology
Blocks can be registered but not available:
- Registered: The block appears in the block inserter
- Available: The block is included in the user's current plan and renders in the front end of the site

## Developing API endpoints for blocks

Blocks may need to access information from the site or from WordPress.com, through endpoints. When developing an endpoint for a block in the Jetpack plugin, you can look at past endpoints in `projects/plugins/jetpack/_inc/lib/core-api/wpcom-endpoints` for inspiration.

Find out more about developing endpoints in the following resources:

- Jetpack APIs Quick Reference Guide PCYsg-CB9-p2
- How to write a REST API endpoint for Jetpack sites in WordPress.com PCYsg-liz-p2

**Note**: if your feature is available in multiple plugins, consider adding the endpoints to a package that will be available to all the plugins that will need it.

## Block upgrade and deprecation paths

When updating block markup or attributes, you will want to avoid block validation errors showing to all current users of the previous version of the block.

In Jetpack the scenario that has been used historically is to create a deprecation. [This developer.wordpress.org guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-deprecation/) explains block deprecation in more detail. An example of block deprecation within Jetpack can be seen from [this `deprecated` directory within the Tiled Gallery block](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/tree/7d97ced29dbbf6bd5c7a5d85bb5d752d9245f1c7/projects/plugins/jetpack/extensions/blocks/tiled-gallery) (see`index.js` in both the `deprecated` folder and the root `tiled-gallery` folder to see the `default` import and export in use).

## Good to know when developing Gutenberg extensions

### The Build

- Compiled extensions are output to `_inc/blocks`
- You can view the various build commands in `package.json`
- You can see the build configuration in `webpack.config.extensions.js`

If you need to modify the build process, bear in mind that config files are also
synced to WordPress.com via Fusion. Consult with a Jetpack crew member to ensure
you test the new build in both environments.

### Debugging

Setting these might be useful for debugging with block editor:

```php
define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
define( 'GUTENBERG_DEVELOPMENT_MODE', true );
```

You could modify `SCRIPT_DEBUG` from `docker/wordpress/wp-config.php` in your Docker environment and add `GUTENBERG_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` there as well, or in your custom mu-plugins file (`docker/mu-plugins/yourfile.php`).

[G Debugger](https://wordpress.org/plugins/g-debugger/) plugin might come handy, too.

### Don't worry about dependencies

The build takes care of core dependencies for both editor and view scripts. React, Lodash and `@wordpress/*` [dependencies](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/docs/contributors/code/scripts.md) are externalized and automatically enqueued in PHP for your extension.

Extensions _always_ get [Gutenberg's polyfill scripts](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/docs/contributors/code/scripts.md#polyfill-scripts) enqueued so you can safely use methods not supported by older browsers such as IE11.

### Jetpack plugin sidebar

Jetpack adds its own [plugin sidebar](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/plugin-sidebar-0/plugin-sidebar-1-up-and-running/) to the block editor. You can find it by choosing "Jetpack" from block the editor's ellipsis menu or by pressing the Jetpack icon in the "pinned plugins" toolbar.

The sidebar itself is always registered in the editor and populated using the [Slot Fill](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components/src/slot-fill#readme) mechanism.

Use the `JetpackPluginSidebar` component to render from anywhere in your plugin's code:

```jsx
import JetpackPluginSidebar from '../../shared/jetpack-plugin-sidebar';

<JetpackPluginSidebar>
	<PanelBody title={ __( 'My sidebar section', 'jetpack' ) }>
		<p>Jetpack is Bestpack!</p>
	</PanelBody>
</JetpackPluginSidebar>
```

The sidebar won't show up at all if nothing is being rendered in the sidebar's "slot".

Remember to be mindful of what post types you want to enable your sidebar section for: e.g. posts, pages, custom post types, and re-usable block post type (`/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wp_block`).

See [Publicize](blocks/publicize/index.js) and [Shortlinks](blocks/shortlinks/index.js) for examples how to limit functionality only to some specific post types or posts. The [Likes](blocks/likes/likes-checkbox.js) & [Sharing](blocks/sharing/sharing-checkbox.js) extensions are a great example of how to [output](shared/jetpack-likes-and-sharing-panel.js) content from several extensions to one sidebar section using "slots".

### i18n

`@wordpress/i18n` doesn't support React elements in strings, but you can use `createInterpolateElement` from `@wordpress/element`.

### Colors

To stay consistent with Gutenberg, your extensions should follow [Gutenberg styles and visuals](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/designers-developers/designers/block-design/).

Use Gutenberg color variables where possible by importing `@automattic/jetpack-base-styles/gutenberg-base-styles`, which in turn imports all variables and mixins published in [`@wordpress/base-styles`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/983c60f25e4bdb7432fde7afdf2b4cc16640f01e/packages/base-styles) package.

The build pipeline also supports [Color studio](https://github.com/Automattic/color-studio) via SASS variables (`$studio-pink-50`) and CSS custom properties (`var( --studio-pink-50 )`) without specifically importing them first. Prefer CSS custom properties when possible.

### Icons

Please use outline versions of [Material icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=outline) to stay in line with Gutenberg. Don't rely on icons used in WordPress core to avoid visual mixing up with core blocks.

### SVG files

When an svg (or other asset) file is imported into js, by default webpack transforms the import into a url for the file. If you would like to import an svg file as a React component (using the [svgr library](https://react-svgr.com/)), append `?component` to the import source. This is particularly useful for [block icons](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-registration/#icon-optional), which need to be either svg markup or a React component.

```js
// index.js for a block
import { getIconColor } from '../../shared/block-icons';
import Icon from './icon.svg?component';

export const settings = {
	...
	icon: {
		src: Icon,
		foreground: getIconColor(),
	},
	...
};
```

## Native support

This is still very much experimental and subject to change.
React Native support for Jetpack blocks is being added as part of the WordPress [Android](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android) and [iOS](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS) apps.
A react-native build configuration will attempt to resolve `.native.js` extensions before `.js` ones, making `.native.js` a simple approach to write "cross-platform" gutenberg blocks.
