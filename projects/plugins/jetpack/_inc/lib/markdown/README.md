# Markdown parsing library

Contains two libraries:

* `/extra`
	- Gives you `MardownExtra_Parser` and `Markdown_Parser`
	- Docs at http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/

* `/gfm` -- Github Flavored Markdown
	- Gives you `WPCom_GHF_Markdown_Parser`
	- It has the same interface as `MarkdownExtra_Parser`
	- Adds support for fenced code blocks: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#fenced-code-blocks
	- By default it replaces them with a code shortcode
	- You can change this using the `$use_code_shortcode` member variable
	- You can change the code shortcode wrapping with `$shortcode_start` and `$shortcode_end` member variables
	- The `$preserve_shortcodes` member variable will preserve all registered shortcodes untouched. Requires WordPress to be loaded for `get_shortcode_regex()`
	- The `$preserve_latex` member variable will preserve oldskool $latex yer-latex$ codes untouched.
	- The `$strip_paras` member variable will strip <p> tags because that's what WordPress likes.
	- See `WPCom_GHF_Markdown_Parser::__construct()` for how the above member variable defaults are set.
