== Description ==
### Write once, publish everywhere.

*Share up to 30 times per month for free with Jetpack Social, and upgrade to share as many times as you want!*

**Grow your following by sharing your content with Jetpack Social!**

It’s important to publish on both your website & social media in order to reach your whole audience. If you only publish on social media, you’re missing up to 60% of adults on a daily basis. Jetpack Social makes it easy to automatically share your site’s posts on popular social media channels such as Facebook and Tumblr. Increase your audience by engaging your site's viewers & your social followers.

**Manage all channels from a single hub to save time**

Don’t have the time to keep up with social media? Jetpack Social pushes your site’s posts and products to all your social media channels in one place, with just a few clicks.

**Set it and forget it!**

Jetpack Social has scheduling tools that allow you to set your posts to publish at the time and day that works for your plan. Schedule your posts in advance so you’re not chained to your desk and publish at the time of day your fans are most engaged on social media.

**Social Image Generator**

With the Jetpack Social Advanced plan, you can have engaging imagery created automatically using the Social Image Generator feature. You can overlay custom text onto your images and choose from a variety of styles to increase engagement on your social posts. Most importantly, you’ll save time by doing it all within the WordPress editor.

**Organic Content Sharing**

Boost your social media engagement with Jetpack Social's Organic Content Sharing feature. Research indicates that manually published posts receive 50% more interaction compared to shared links. Our feature allows you to select custom images, videos, and text to share your blog posts as native social media content, enhancing engagement and saving you time. This feature is available with the Jetpack Social Advanced plan only.
