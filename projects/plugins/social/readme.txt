### How do I connect to social networks?

Navigate to Tools → Marketing → Connections.
Click Connect next to the Social Network you want to connect to.
Log in to that Social Network site and authorize the connection.
* Facebook Pages
* Twitter

After you add a new connection, you have the option to make the connection ‘global’, meaning it can also be used by any other user on your site who has the ability to publish posts.

You’ll then see the Publicize options under the **Share this post** section, where you can toggle social media connections, connect new services, and write a custom message to be used when your post is shared.
