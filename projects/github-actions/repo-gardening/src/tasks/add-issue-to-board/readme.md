# Add Issue to Board

Add issues to a specific board based on the labels used on the issue.

## Rationale

Quickly triaging issues and directing them to the right team as quickly as possible is important. If we automatically add issues to the right board depending on the labels used on the issue, we should be able to speed up that process.
