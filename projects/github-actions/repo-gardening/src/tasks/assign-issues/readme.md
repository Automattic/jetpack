# Assign Issues

Adds assignee for issues which are being worked on, and adds the "In Progress" label.

## Rationale

For users who would be affected by an issue (including the issue's creator), it is useful to receive progress updates once efforts have begun to address the issue.

[Issue assignment](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users) is a useful GitHub feature for developers, as it can avoid a scenario where multiple developers spend effort toward resolving the same issue due to the fact that progress was not clearly communicated.
