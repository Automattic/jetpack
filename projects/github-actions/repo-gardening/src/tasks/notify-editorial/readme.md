# Notify Editorial

Send a Slack notification to the Editorial team when we need their input on a PR.

This task responds to the following labels:

- "[Status] Needs Copy Review"
- "[Status] Needs Copy"

When one of the labels above is added to a PR, a Slack message will be sent to channel of your choice.

## Rationale

Adding a label to a PR allows us to signify that we'd like input from our Editorial team on a project.
