# Flag OSS

Flags PRs opened by external contributors (not from a branch on the main repo), and adds the "OSS Citizen" label.

## Rationale

Marking PRs opened by external contributors allows us to welcome such contributors and give them the tips they need to learn and have the best contributing experience.
