# Flag OSS

Flags PRs opened by external contributors (not from a branch on the main repo), adds the "OSS Citizen" label, and posts a Slack message to your team channel to let everyone know you've got a contribution from an external contributor.

## Rationale

Marking PRs opened by external contributors allows us to welcome such contributors and give them the tips they need to learn and have the best contributing experience.
