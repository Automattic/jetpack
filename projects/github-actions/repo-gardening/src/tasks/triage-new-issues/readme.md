# Triage New Issues

Add labels to newly opened issues to indicate what plugin is impacted by the issue.

This is best used in combination with GitHub [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms).

## Rationale

Adding a label to new issues allows each plugin team to get quick notices of issues that need their attention, without having to wait for a nanual triage.
