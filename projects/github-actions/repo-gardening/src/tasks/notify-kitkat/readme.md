# Notify KitKat

**Kitkat is the WordPress.com Quality team. If your quality team is named differently, you can still use this task! :)**

Send a Slack notification to KitKat when there is a high or blocker priority bug, or a bug with no priority label.

This task responds to the following labels:

- "[Pri] BLOCKER"
- "[Pri] High"

When one of the labels above is added to an issue, a Slack message will be sent to channel of your choice.

## Rationale

This alert will help improve triage times which should then improve MTTR.
