# WordPress.com Commit Reminder

Post a comment on merged PRs to remind Automatticians to commit the matching WordPress.com change.

**Note:** this will only be useful if your repository uses Fusion.

## Rationale

When an Automattician merges a change to a file in Jetpack that also exists on WordPress.com, it's nice to bring that change to WordPress.com site owners as well. We offer tools to automate some of that work, but the actual commit is your responsibility. 
Once you've merged your Jetpack PR, we'll comment to remind you to commit to WordPress.com.
