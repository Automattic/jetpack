# Gather support references

Happiness Engineers can comment on issues to add references to support interactions with customers that would like to be updated whenever the problem is solved.

This task creates a new comment that lists all support references found in all comments on the issue.

## Rationale

Gathering all references into a single, actionable comment makes it easier to follow-up, without having to hunt for ticket references, especially on issues with a large amount of comments.
