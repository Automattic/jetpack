### Added
- Added lint to ensure httponly is set (or intentionally ignored) on setcookie. [#24418]

### Fixed
- Fixed minor coding standard violation.
- Resync PHPUnitTestTrait hack and have it detect "Testcase" in addition to "TestCase".
- Update `wp-coding-standards/wpcs` to `dev-develop`. They haven't done a release in over a year, and we need fixes for errors in PHP 8.0 and 8.1.

### Added
- Add a sniff to check the textdomain passed to `Assets::register_script()`.

### Changed
- Disable CI tests on 8.1, PHPCompatibility raises deprecation warnings.

- Switch to pcov for code coverage.
- Updated package dependencies

- Updated package dependencies.
- Update PHPUnit configs to include just what needs coverage rather than include everything then try to exclude stuff that doesn't.

## [2.2.1] - 2021-08-26
### Added
- Composer alias for dev-master, to improve dependencies.
- Created a changelog from the git history with help from [auto-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-changelog). It could probably use cleanup!

### Changed
- Run composer update on test-php command instead of phpunit.
- Update package dependencies.

### Fixed
