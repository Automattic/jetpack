## [2.4.0] - 2022-02-01
### Added
- Add a sniff to check the textdomain passed to `Assets::register_script()`.

### Changed

## [2.3.0] - 2021-11-02

- Tests: update PHPUnit polyfills dependency (yoast/phpunit-polyfills).
- Updated mediawiki/mediawiki-codesniffer to v38.
- Updated package dependencies.

## [2.2.1] - 2021-08-26
### Added
- Composer alias for dev-master, to improve dependencies.
- Created a changelog from the git history with help from [auto-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-changelog). It could probably use cleanup!

### Changed
- Run composer update on test-php command instead of phpunit.
- Update package dependencies.
