## How to consume Stats package

### Install the right packages

First, let's make sure that the `automattic/jetpack-stats` package is set up in your composer.json file:

At minimum you need three things. One is the `automattic/jetpack-autoloader` package, which will ensure that you're not colliding with any other plugins on the site that may be including the same packages. Two, of course, is the `automattic/jetpack-stats` package. Third is our `automattic/jetpack-config` package that will be your tool for initializing the packages.

### Initialize the package

Second, we must initialize ("configure") the `jetpack-stats` package within your plugin, and provide the information about it.

This is where the `jetpack-config` and `jetpack-autoload` packages come into play. Do this, and you're ready to start consuming the Jetpack connection!

```php
use Automattic\Jetpack\Config;

require_once plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . '/vendor/autoload_packages.php';

function jpcs_load_plugin() {

	// Here we enable the Jetpack packages.
	$config = new Config();
	$config->ensure( 'stats' );
}

add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'jpcs_load_plugin', 1 );
```


## Tracking Pixel
Stats Package uses a tracking pixel to send information to WordPress.com. 

This is done by enqueueing a JavaScript file in the footer of the site `https://stats.wp.com/e-202103.js` (the number changes every week but the file remains the same). 
That JavaScript file, in turn, inserts a tracking pixel to the end of the page. For example: `https://pixel.wp.com/g.gif?lots_of_parameters_here`
When that tracking pixel is loaded by the browser, it effectively sends information to WordPress.com about what needs to be logged on.

### Parameters tracked

#### Default parameters
The default parameters being tracked are built with the `Automattic\Jetpack\Stats\TrackingPixel::build_view_data` function.
- **v**: (internal) Used to distinguish self-hosted sites from the ones hosted on WordPress.com. Enum: `ext, wpcom`
- **blog**: The blog ID of the site
- **post**: The id of the post for the site. 0 if it is not a post.
- **tz**: The GMT offset
- **srv**: THe URL of the server.

#### How to extend default parameters
There is a filter that can be used to track more parameters. `stats_array`

```php
add_filter( 'stats_array', 'filter_stats_array_add_custom_stat' );

/**
 * Add custom stat to the stats tracking data.
 *
 * @param  param array $kvs The stats array in key values.
 * @return array
 */
function filter_stats_array_add_custom_stat( $kvs ) {
	$kvs['custom_stat'] = 'my_custom_stat'
	return $kvs;
```
