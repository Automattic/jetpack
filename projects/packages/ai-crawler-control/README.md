# AI Crawler Control

Indicate to AI crawlers that they should not index your siteâ€™s content.

This package does so in 2 different ways:

1. It adds lines to the site's `robots.txt` to encourage AI user agents to not crawl the site.
2. It creates a `/ai.txt` file, as proposed by [Spawning.ai](https://spawning.ai/ai-txt). It marks a full list of file extensions as not indexable by AI agents.

## How to install AI Crawler Control

The package can be required in your WordPress plugin or theme via Composer:

```bash
composer require automattic/ai-crawler-control
```

In addition to this package, we would recommend that you use [Jetpack Autoloader](https://packagist.org/packages/automattic/jetpack-autoloader) as your autoloader. This will allow for maximum interoperability with other plugins that use this package as well.

Then, within your WordPress project (plugin or theme), you can initialize the package by calling the `init` method:

```php
\Automattic\Jetpack\Ai_Crawler_Control::init();
```
