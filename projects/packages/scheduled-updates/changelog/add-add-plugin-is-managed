Adds IsManaged key to plugins list via a filter.

This adds a key `isManaged` to the return value of `get_plugins()` which is then synced via Jetpack Sync to WP.com's cache site. isManaged is true if the plugin is managed on Atomic, i.e. it is symlinked and its target points to a `wordpress` directory. This is used by scheduled updates to understand if the plugin can be updated or not.
