Significance: minor
Type: changed

Scheduled updates: Modified the `allowlist_scheduled_plugins` function to check scheduled update requests.

Change the `allowlist_scheduled_plugins` function to include a check for the `SCHEDULED_AUTOUPDATE` constant. This allows us to identify requests coming from scheduled updates and include the relevant plugins when the `auto_update_plugin` hook is triggered.
