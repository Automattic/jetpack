### Fixed
- Fixed scheduled updates returning is_managed = true for non-root symlinks to /wordpress directory. [#36170]

## [0.3.0] - 2024-03-04
### Added
- Added a Cron API function to retrieve all events scheduled for a specified hook. [#36071]
- Adds an is_managed key to the wp/v2 sites/%s/plugins API. This key checks if the plugin is managed on Atomic by verifying if it's symlinked. [#36098]

### Changed
- Aligned handling of schedules that can't be found to return the same error messages. [#35963]
