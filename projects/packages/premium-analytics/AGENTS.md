## Overview

Jetpack Premium Analytics is the unified analytics dashboard for Jetpack-connected sites — a
full-page React SPA in wp-admin. It is the successor to two older surfaces being consolidated
here: **Jetpack Stats** (`stats-admin` package, Odyssey dashboard — traffic, posts,
subscribers, WordAds, notices) and **Woo Analytics** (`woocommerce-analytics` package — store
reports: orders, products, customers, coupons, order attribution).

- Composer package: `automattic/jetpack-premium-analytics`
- PHP namespace: `Automattic\Jetpack\PremiumAnalytics`
- Text domain / REST namespace: `jetpack-premium-analytics` / `jetpack-premium-analytics/v1`

## How it works

`Analytics::init()` loads the generated `build/build.php`, which registers an `admin_init`
interceptor for `?page=jetpack-premium-analytics`. The interceptor takes over the request
before WordPress renders the admin chrome; `@wordpress/boot` provides the SPA shell and
routing; each route under `routes/<name>/` is a lazy-loaded ES module discovered at build time
from its `package.json`. WordPress core or Jetpack's wp-build polyfills provide the WordPress
script handles/modules used by the dashboard, so the Gutenberg plugin is not required.

## Structure

```text
src/class-analytics.php                 # entry: loads build, registers menu + routes
src/REST/class-api-proxy-controller.php # the WPCOM data proxy (PREFIX_CONFIG)
src/REST/class-notices-controller.php   # /notices route
src/Sync/                               # interim woocommerce_analytics sync (WOOA7S-1550)
packages/data/src/api/                  # frontend fetch helpers (apiFetch)
routes/                                 # lazy-loaded SPA pages; build/ is generated
```

## Development

```bash
composer phpunit              # PHP tests
pnpm run build / watch        # frontend build (one-off / on change)
jetpack build packages/premium-analytics
```

Add a route: create `routes/<name>/package.json` (with `route.path` + `route.page`) and a
`stage.tsx` exporting `stage()`; rebuild — routes are auto-discovered.

Depends on `jetpack-connection`, `jetpack-stats`, `jetpack-sync`, `jetpack-config`.

## API

Two local REST surfaces; almost all data comes from WordPress.com via one agnostic proxy.

### Data proxy

`GET|POST /jetpack-premium-analytics/v1/proxy/v<version>/<prefix>/<sub-path>` forwards to
`public-api.wordpress.com/.../sites/<blog-id>/<prefix>/<sub-path>` signed as the connected blog
(no cross-origin or user-authed call).

- `<version>` is the WPCOM version (`1.1`, `1.2`, `2`); base derives from it (`v2`→`wpcom/`,
  `v1.x`→`rest/`). Use the version the old call used — the proxy does not normalise.
- `<blog-id>` is injected server-side — never put it in the path.
- `<prefix>` must be allowlisted in `PREFIX_CONFIG` or the route 404s. This is the security
  boundary — the blog token is only forwarded for these.

| Prefix | Capability | Writes (POST) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `analytics` (Woo store reports) | `manage_options` | — |
| `stats` | `view_stats` | `stats/referrers/spam/` |
| `wordads` | `activate_wordads` | — |
| `subscribers` / `site-has-never-published-post` / `jetpack-stats` | `view_stats` | — |
| `jetpack-stats-dashboard` | `view_stats` | whole prefix (busts read cache) |
| `commercial-classification` | `view_stats` | exact path |
| `upgrades` (not under `/sites/`) | `view_stats` | — |

`manage_options` is always accepted too. `POST` is rejected (`405 rest_read_only`) outside the
Writes column. Query params pass through except control params (`endpoint`, `version`,
`force_refresh`) and `site`. Successful `GET`s are cached 5 min (key: path+version+params); add
`force_refresh` to bypass. `x-wp-total` / `x-wp-totalpages` are forwarded back. Errors:
`403 no_connection`, `500`/`502 api_error`, `405 rest_read_only`, `401`/`403` on a failed cap.

### Notices

`GET|POST /jetpack-premium-analytics/v1/notices` (`{ id, status, postponed_for }`). Not proxied
because GET merges WPCOM dismissal state with local flags. Anything needing local processing
gets its own route outside `proxy/`, like this.

### Adding a proxied endpoint

To add a transparent forward, add a key to `PREFIX_CONFIG` (at least `capability`; add
`writes` / `cache_bust` as needed) and cover it in `data_endpoint_matrix()`.

### Migrating from Stats / Woo Analytics

Re-point a screen's data layer at the proxy instead of re-implementing old routes: `stats-admin`
routes (`jetpack/v4/stats-app/*`) → `stats` / `jetpack-stats` / `subscribers` / `wordads`
prefixes; Woo `analytics/reports/*` → `proxy/v2/analytics/reports/*`. The dashboard UI lives in
`routes/` here, not in Calypso. Frontend helpers go under `packages/data/src/api/`.

## Pitfalls

- Never put the blog ID in a proxy path — it's injected server-side.
- A proxy 404 usually means the prefix isn't in `PREFIX_CONFIG`, not a missing WPCOM endpoint.
- Reads are cached 5 min; add `force_refresh` if a screen looks stale.
- `v2` vs `v1.x` changes the WPCOM base — a wrong version silently hits a different endpoint.
- Sync code under `src/Sync/` is interim (WOOA7S-1550); don't build on it.
- Don't edit dashboard React in Calypso — it lives here now.
