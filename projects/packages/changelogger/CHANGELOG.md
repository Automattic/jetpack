## [3.0.1] - 2021-10-19
### Fixed
- Fix the situation where the current is "1.2.3-beta" and we're looking at the dev branch towards the -alpha following the 1.2.3 release, it shouldn't ignore significances.

## [3.0.0] - 2021-10-13
### Changed

## [1.2.1] - 2021-08-30
### Changed
- Run composer update on test-php command instead of phpunit
- Tests: update PHPUnit polyfills dependency (yoast/phpunit-polyfills).

## [1.2.0] - 2021-05-12
### Added
- New option, `--filename-auto-suffix`, to ensure that a reused branch won't prevent entry creation in non-interactive mode.

### Deprecated
- Changelogger `Config::setOutput()` is no longer needed. Config will throw a ConfigException instead of printing an error.

### Fixed
- If composer.json is not present in the current directory, check parents and ask if the parent should be used (like composer does).

### Added
- Allow "unreleased" as the date for a changelog entry.
- Enable GitHub action for auto-tagging releases from monorepo pushes.

### Changed
- Branch-alias dev-master rather than dev-monorepo, as we're removing the hack.

### Fixed
- Use `composer update` rather than `install` in scripts, as composer.lock isn't checked in.

## 1.0.0 - 2021-03-08
### Added
- Initial version.
