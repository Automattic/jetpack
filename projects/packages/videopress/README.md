VideoPress package

## How to consume VideoPress package

### Install the right packages

First, let's make sure that the `automattic/jetpack-videopress` package is set up in your composer.json file:

At minimum you need three things. One is the `automattic/jetpack-autoloader` package, which will ensure that you're not colliding with any other plugins on the site that may be including the same packages. Two, of course, is the `automattic/jetpack-videopress` package. Third is our `automattic/jetpack-config` package that will be your tool for initializing the packages.

### Initialize the package

Second, we must initialize ("configure") the `jetpack-videopress` package within your plugin, and provide the information about it.

This is where the `jetpack-config` and `jetpack-autoload` packages come into play. Do this, and you're ready to start consuming the Jetpack connection!

```php
use Automattic\Jetpack\Config;

require_once plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . '/vendor/autoload_packages.php';

function jpcs_load_plugin() {

	// Here we enable the Jetpack packages.
	$config = new Config();
	$config->ensure( 'videopress' );
}

add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'jpcs_load_plugin', 1 );
```

### Initialization Options

When initializing VideoPress, you can choose whether you want to initialize the Admin UI or not. By default, the admin UI is not initialized. If you want it, just add the `admin_ui` key in your options when ensuring the feature:

```PHP
$config = new Config();
$config->ensure(
	'videopress',
	array( 'admin_ui' => true )
);
```
