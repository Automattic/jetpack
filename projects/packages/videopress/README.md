# VideoPress

VideoPress package

## How to consume VideoPress package

### Install the right packages

First, let's make sure that the `automattic/jetpack-videopress` package is set up in your composer.json file:

At minimum you need three things. One is the `automattic/jetpack-autoloader` package, which will ensure that you're not colliding with any other plugins on the site that may be including the same packages. Two, of course, is the `automattic/jetpack-videopress` package. Third is our `automattic/jetpack-config` package that will be your tool for initializing the packages.

### Initialize the package

Second, we must initialize ("configure") the `jetpack-videopress` package within your plugin, and provide the information about it.

This is where the `jetpack-config` and `jetpack-autoload` packages come into play. Do this, and you're ready to start consuming the Jetpack connection!

```php
use Automattic\Jetpack\Config;

require_once plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'vendor/autoload_packages.php';

function jpcs_load_plugin() {

	// Here we enable the Jetpack packages.
	$config = new Config();
	$config->ensure( 'videopress' );
}

add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'jpcs_load_plugin', 1 );
```

### Initialization Options

When initializing VideoPress, you can choose whether you want to initialize the Admin UI or not. By default, the admin UI is not initialized. If you want it, just add the `admin_ui` key in your options when ensuring the feature:

```PHP
$config = new Config();
$config->ensure(
	'videopress',
	array( 'admin_ui' => true )
);
```

## Using this package in your WordPress plugin

If you plan on using this package in your WordPress plugin, we would recommend that you use [Jetpack Autoloader](https://packagist.org/packages/automattic/jetpack-autoloader) as your autoloader. This will allow for maximum interoperability with other plugins that use this package as well.

## Premium Analytics dashboard

The package owns two widgets of the Premium Analytics dashboard, built here with wp-build against the dashboard's SDK (`@automattic/jetpack-premium-analytics-sdk`) and registered when the dashboard's widget registry hydrates: Top videos (`widgets/top-videos/`, `videopress/top-videos`), which the registrant also seeds into the Traffic section's default layout, and the video player (`widgets/video-player/`, `videopress/video-player`), which the dashboard's video report composes.

The package decides nothing about who gets the widgets. `Initializer` calls `Analytics_Dashboard::init()` where VideoPress is active outside the WordPress.com platform; `jetpack-mu-wpcom` calls the registrants on Simple and Atomic where the plan includes VideoPress. Both are inert on a site without the dashboard.

## Playlist publication analytics

The existing `jetpack_videopress_playlist_block_published` and `jetpack_videopress_latest_videos_playlist_block_published` events record an observed manual publication save only after the editor finishes saving, reports success, and exposes a saved `publish` status for the same post. Failed attempts, autosaves, previews, ordinary updates to published posts, and saves already underway when the tracking hook mounts are excluded. Missing required editor selectors or an unknown first block also suppress reporting.

The first block of each type supplies the existing `post_type`, `layout`, `video_count`, and `playlist_count` properties, captured when saving starts. A captured save can finish after that block unmounts or changes; its listener is released on completion or a post-context switch. No post or video identifier is sent. These remain client events subject to the existing Tracks configuration and delivery limitations, not a complete server publication ledger.

The two block types report separately: adding their totals does not count distinct posts. Counts and layout describe the editor snapshot, not server-filtered content; latest-videos membership can also change after publication. Republish operations can count again. Keep pre-fix attempt counts separate from post-rollout acknowledged counts when comparing trends.
