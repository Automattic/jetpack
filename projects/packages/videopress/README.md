# VideoPress

VideoPress package

## How to consume VideoPress package

### Install the right packages

First, let's make sure that the `automattic/jetpack-videopress` package is set up in your composer.json file:

At minimum you need three things. One is the `automattic/jetpack-autoloader` package, which will ensure that you're not colliding with any other plugins on the site that may be including the same packages. Two, of course, is the `automattic/jetpack-videopress` package. Third is our `automattic/jetpack-config` package that will be your tool for initializing the packages.

### Initialize the package

Second, we must initialize ("configure") the `jetpack-videopress` package within your plugin, and provide the information about it.

This is where the `jetpack-config` and `jetpack-autoload` packages come into play. Do this, and you're ready to start consuming the Jetpack connection!

```php
use Automattic\Jetpack\Config;

require_once plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'vendor/autoload_packages.php';

function jpcs_load_plugin() {

	// Here we enable the Jetpack packages.
	$config = new Config();
	$config->ensure( 'videopress' );
}

add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'jpcs_load_plugin', 1 );
```

### Initialization Options

When initializing VideoPress, you can choose whether you want to initialize the Admin UI or not. By default, the admin UI is not initialized. If you want it, just add the `admin_ui` key in your options when ensuring the feature:

```PHP
$config = new Config();
$config->ensure(
	'videopress',
	array( 'admin_ui' => true )
);
```

## Using this package in your WordPress plugin

If you plan on using this package in your WordPress plugin, we would recommend that you use [Jetpack Autoloader](https://packagist.org/packages/automattic/jetpack-autoloader) as your autoloader. This will allow for maximum interoperability with other plugins that use this package as well.

## Premium Analytics dashboard

The package owns two widgets of the Premium Analytics dashboard, built here with wp-build against the dashboard's SDK (`@automattic/jetpack-premium-analytics-sdk`) and registered when the dashboard's widget registry hydrates: Top videos (`widgets/top-videos/`, `videopress/top-videos`), which the registrant also seeds into the Traffic section's default layout, and the video player (`widgets/video-player/`, `videopress/video-player`), which the dashboard's video report composes.

The package decides nothing about who gets the widgets. `Initializer` calls `Analytics_Dashboard::init()` where VideoPress is active outside the WordPress.com platform; `jetpack-mu-wpcom` calls the registrants on Simple and Atomic where the plan includes VideoPress. Both are inert on a site without the dashboard.

## Media Library upload source

Promoting a local attachment through `/videopress/v1/upload/{id}` sends `source=dashboard_promote` from the VideoPress dashboard and `source=block_editor` from the video block's Media Library picker. Both upload loops retain the optional, bounded value through subsequent chunks, and the PHP uploader forwards it into TUS creation metadata. Other PHP and REST callers remain unlabeled unless they explicitly supply a supported source.

WordPress.com Simple sends the same source labels through its separate `/wpcom/v2/videopress/promote/{id}` route. After verifying a new registration, the endpoint fires `jetpack_videopress_attachment_promoted` with the canonical video, site ID and optional source for server-side consumers. Failed promotions and requests for already-promoted videos do not fire this action.

This identifies the initiating surface, not a new attachment, successful processing or first playability. Simple promotion does not transfer the file again. Already-promoted attachments do not start another transfer, and resumed TUS resources keep their original creation metadata. Server-side persistence and query availability must be verified before using this source in reporting.
