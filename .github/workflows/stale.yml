            <p>This issue has been marked as stale. This happened because:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>It has been inactive for the past 6 months.</li>
              <li>It hasn’t been labeled `[Pri] BLOCKER`, `[Pri] High`, `[Type] Feature Request`, `[Type] Enhancement`, `Good For Community`, `[Type] Good First Bug`, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>No further action is needed. But it's worth checking if this ticket has clear
            reproduction steps and it is still reproducible. Feel free to close this issue
            if you think it's not valid anymore — if you do, please add a brief
            explanation.</p>
