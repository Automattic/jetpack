# This Github Action is temporary, to run the development version of PHPCompatibility to test for PHP 8 issues.
#
# Once we're getting that by default (likely due to an upgrade of automattic/jetpack-codesniffer to pull a version of phpcompatibility/phpcompatibility-wp that pulls phpcompatibility/php-compatibility 10.0+),
# this action and .github/files/phpcompatibility-dev-phpcs.xml should be deleted.
