# Want to contribute?

Did you know that you could be instrumental in making Jetpack more robust and secure? If you use and love Jetpack, why not contribute to the project?

## Contributing for Everyone!

Whether you can barely recognize a filter (or don’t know what that means) or you’ve already authored your own plugins, there are ways for you to pitch in.

### Beta Testing

Beta testers give updates, fixes, and new modules a test run before they’re publicly released, so they’re an important part of the development process. If you'd like to join our Beta group, [sign up to be a Beta tester here](http://jetpack.com/beta/).

### Create Bug Reports

If you find a bug, just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/), that’s all. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the URL of the page that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead. You can [check our recommendations to create great bug reports here](/docs/guides/report-bugs.md).

### Translate the plugin

If you speak a foreign language, you can help translate Jetpack into your own language. [here is how.](/docs/translations.md)

### Write and submit a patch

If you'd like to fix a bug, you can submit a Pull Request. Before you get started, you'll want to **[set up your development environment.](/docs/development-environment.md)**

Once your development environment is ready, you can get started and [create your first Pull Request!](/docs/pull-request.md)

#### Where to get started?

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to get started, you can take a look at existing issues:

- ["Good First Bug"](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/labels/%5BType%5D%20Good%20First%20Bug) issues are a good entry point to get familiar with Jetpack's codebase.
- All issues labeled with [the "Community" milestone](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3ACommunity) are fair game. That's a great way to contribute new features and fix small issues within Jetpack.
- ["Whisky"](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/labels/Whisky%20Ticket) issues are important bugs or enhancements. Take a crack at it if you feel adventurous! :)

Are you new to Git? You can [follow these detailed steps to find out how to submit your first patch.](/docs/guides/submit-patch.md)

#### We’re Here To Help

We encourage you to ask for help at any point. We want your first experience with Jetpack to be a good one, so don’t be shy. If you’re wondering why something is the way it is, or how a decision was made, you can create an issue and prefix it with “Question:”.
