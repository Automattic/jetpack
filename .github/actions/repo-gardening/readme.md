# GitHub repository gardening

This action includes multiple different tasks to automate some of the things we must do to each issue and PR that is handled in the repo.

Here is the current list of tasks handled by this action:

- Assign Issues: Adds assignee for issues which are being worked on, and adds the "In Progress" label.
- Add Milestone: Adds a valid milestone to all PRs that get merged and don't already include a milestone.
