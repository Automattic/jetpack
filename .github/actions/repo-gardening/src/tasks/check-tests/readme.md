# Check Tests

Provide feedback to PR authors if they've marked a PR as ready for review while some of the checks on the PR are failing.

## Rationale

Before one asks for a review on their PR, that PR should be ready to be reviewed, free of errors that can be detected by our automated test suite. Since checks can take a little while to complete, it can take a few minutes before tests report some problems on a PR you've been working on. At this point, a comment on the PR can be a useful reminder to come back to look at your PR since it's not quite ready for a review yet.
