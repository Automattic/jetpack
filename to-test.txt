This file contains a list of items that need testing for each release.  Please update it with every pull request. Make sure to follow the same format.
==============================
=== 3.8 ===

== New Features/Enhancements ==
* Google+ Sidebar Widget
New widget!
To test: Add widget in both wp-admin and Customizer. Make sure there are no errors when adding either a person, page, or community badge.

Example Google+ urls to use:

https://plus.google.com/communities/101504763068635549461?hl=en (community)
https://plus.google.com/+WordPress/posts?hl=en (page)
https://plus.google.com/u/0/106016569422981142354/posts (profile)

* Social Media Icons: Add Google+
Adding Google+ to the Social Media Icons widget. 
To test: set up a Google+ account in the widget using a Google+ username/user ID. Typically it's the value found in your Google+ page URL: https://plus.google.com/[USER_ID]/posts. Try with both the numerical value or a custom Google+ name if your URL uses +FirstName in the [USER_ID] instead of a numerical value.

* Sharing: Remove Twitter share counts. 
Due to Twitter removing support for third party sharing counts, we needed to remove the option from our Twitter sharing buttons. 
To test: Enable the Twitter sharing button (Icon, Icon + Text, or Text only) on a post that has Twitter share counts - you can verify existing counts by using the Official button - and verify that the share counts have been removed. 

* Contact Form: Check for valid email address.
We've added a check to see if the "To" address in the Contact Form meets the Official Standard: RFC 5322 -- http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html.
To test: Set up a contact form "To" address using an invalid email address. For example: "thisemail@is.invalid" or similar. You should see an alert message notifying you of the invalid email address.

* Contact Form: Checkbox with multiple items
In previous versions of Jetpack, if you wanted multiple checkboxes on your Contact Form, you had to enter one per field. Now, you can have multiple checkbox options in a single form field.
To test: Create a contact form using the new "Checkbox with Multiple Items" field type and ensure that they work properly in contact form submissions. 

* Shortcodes: Add Twitch.tv shortcode embeds
Adding the Twitch.tv shortcode from WordPress.com.
To test: Add shortcode to a post or page. The most basic form of the shortcode requires only the URL parameter, and looks like this: [twitchtv url="http://www.twitch.tv/paperbat/b/323486192"]

You can also add additional parameters to customize the appearance:

height – defaults to 378 pixels
width – defaults to 620 pixels
autoplay – defaults to false

A more advanced shortcode would look something like: [twitchtv url="http://www.twitch.tv/paperbat" width="400" height="244" autoplay="true"]

== Fixes ==
* Subscriptions: better error messaging for blocked emails. 
Previously, if you had blocked emails from WordPress.com, then tried to subscribe to a page using Jetpack Subscriptions, you would never receive the confirmation email. 
To test: Using your WordPress.com account, log into subscribe.wordpress.com, go to the Settings tab, and check the box to block all emails from WordPress.com and save. Leaving that window open, open a new tab/window to your test site (where you are not already subscribed to your site) and attempt to sign up using the same email address. Verify that the error message says "The email address has opted out of subscription emails." and includes a link to where you can fix the issue Then, refresh the subscribe.wordpress.com page and check to see if your subscription request is listed under the "Pending" tab. Don't forget to uncheck the "block emails" option under Settings when you're finished testing. 

* Infinite Scroll: Use theme posts_per_page variable if set. 
Previously, Jetpack ignored the posts_per_page variable set when declaring theme support for Infinite Scroll when the site was set to load additional posts on click. Now, if this variable is set in the theme, Jetpack will use the theme's variable when loading posts via Infinite Scroll.
To test: Using a theme that uses a posts_per_page that is not 7 (the default for Infinite Scroll), test to see whether or not the custom posts_per_page number is used when Infinite Scroll is enabled.

Past Releases
=============
=== 3.7 ===

== New Features/Enhancements ==
* New admin page UI!
You'll notice that the main Jetpack admin page has changed.
To test: Please follow these instructions https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/2549, and anything else you can think of.

* Staging Site Support!
Clone your site's database to a new site, e.g. using a host's staging site feature. Previously, since both databases had the needed info to communicate to WordPress.com's record for the original site, there would be lots of things broken/weird. Now, when opening on a site where WP.com and your site's siteurl/homeurl settings differ, we'll prompt you to ask what's going on.
To test: A brand new site cloned from an existing one: Confirm that the "Reset Connection" option properly connects the new site (e.g. the stats aren't shared with another site) and the original site remains operational.
To test: On a staging site, any changes made (e.g. creating new posts) are not reflected on the WP.com record. Example way to check: Visit the wordpress.com My Sites for the original test site and confirm any posts made only on the staging site aren't listed as a post there.

* Subscriptions per-post opt out!
When using the Subscriptions module, you can now opt-out individual posts from being sent out to subscribers.
To test: Toggle the checkmark in the publish meta box on an unpublished post.

* Switched notifications to API v1.1
To test: Make sure that new notification overlay is properly displayed both in the admin area and in the front-end area.

* Reddit "Official" Sharing Button
To test: Confirm that, when using the official Reddit button, the Reddit posting page opens in a new window/tab, not the original.

* Publicize Custom Message: Previously, once a custom Publicize message was set, it could not be completely removed.
To test: Set a custom message when writing a new post, save a draft, then come back and remove the message to restore the default settings.

* Open Graph tags with smart punctuation
To test: Set the post title or description (e.g. excerpt) to use smart punctuation—curly quotes, angled apostrophes, etc, and confirm sharing on various services that use OG tags works as expected (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc).

* New VideoPress player
Updates the Jetpack VideoPress player to HTML 5 when using the [wpvideo] shortcode and registers VideoPress as an oEmbed provider.
To test: Add an VideoPress permalink into the editor to test oEmbed.
To test: Play videos via oEmbed and the wpvideo shortcode on a number of browser/OS combinations.

* PollDaddy shortcode
The PollDaddy shortcode had been updated and enhanced quite a bit on WP.com. 3.7 brings those enhancements downstream.
To test: Add a PD poll via the Shortcode. Confirm it loads and no JS errors (JS changed to async)
To test: Add a PD poll via oEmbed (dropping in the poll.fm link). New to Jetpack.
To test: Add a PD poll via Shortcode on a HTTPS site. Expected: Works with no mixed content issues.

* Widget Visibility Enhancement!
A new rule has been added to show/hide widgets based on Parent Page. Very helpful for all of your hierarchical page-based site needs!
To test: Set widget visibility option for a parent page, confirm works as expected on a child of that page.

* bbPress Love!
Previously, Jetpack didn't insert Sharing buttons on bbPress CPTs even if they were set to be used via Settings->Sharing
To test: Enable Sharing on bbPress CPTs and confirm they're added.

== Fixes ==
* No longer forcing http:// on API urls
To test: If you have a site that uses HTTPS, please test to ensure that social sharing, shortlinks, and managing your site through WordPress.com all work as expected

* Edit Posts List Table: Fixed the styling associated with the Likes column resulting from 4.3 changes.
To test: Confirm no visual oddities while on either WP 4.2.x or 4.3.x

* Facebook Embeds: In some cases, the script loaded early resulting in no embed
To test: Try embedding a FB post using the Facebook shortcode.

* Sharing/Likes: Front Page settings
To test: Set a page as your site's front page and confirm the "Front Page" sharing option is respected.

* Open Graph Tags
DailyMotion videos are treated the same as YouTube/Vimeo. If the logic suggests a video screencap should be used, it'll now include DailyMotion.
