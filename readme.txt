If you're interested in learning more about the extra layers of protection and advanced tools available, learn more about our [paid plans](https://jetpack.com/pricing?from=wporg).

= Why do I need a WordPress.com account? =

A WordPress.com account is different from the account you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress.

Once you've installed Jetpack your stats will be available on [WordPress.com/Stats](https://wordpress.com/stats), on the official [WordPress mobile apps](https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/), and on your Jetpack dashboard.

= 4.3.2 =

* Release date: October 13, 2016

**Enhancements**

* Unsaved changes were getting lost when users were navigating away from settings so we put in a confirmation message to prevent this from happening.
* We've stopped counting carousel views in stats by default, you can use the `jetpack_enable_carousel_stats` filter to enable counting them again.
* Stats are now responding faster.
* There were several improvements and repairs made to sync including additional endpoints, performance enhancements, whitelisted data, better decision making around when to sync information, and more.
* Markdown now has a CSS class on footnotes.

**Improved Compatibility:**

* We've improved compatibility with Kinsta by automatically turning on Staging Mode for Jetpack when in a staging environment.

**Bug Fixes:**

* Several fixes have been made to sync to repair issues with Publicize, Notifications, and Subscriptions.
* We removed PHP warnings by checking to make sure json language files like jetpack-en_US.json are readable before we load them.
* We found an unused option in Gravatar Hovercard settings and removed it.
* The correct support link is now being used to make it easier for you to connect with the Jetpack team if you need us.
* The permissions check for plugin information retrieval was fixed as well.
* Some plugins were adding content on outbound http requests causing an infinite loop we fixed this right up.
* We removed some warnings that were occurring when translations didn't exist by adding a fallback.
* We've added Moroccan Arabic translations, and switched to language packs for Croatian, Spanish (Chile) and Greek.
* Sync was running into issues so we've limited dequeue time to 1/3 of PHP's max execution time, which has unclogged the problem.
* We're now sending full and incremental queues separately so that a failure in one doesn't block the other.
* There was a JavaScript enqueuing error with our Sharing feature that has been repaired.
* The Top Posts widget now includes the ability to list attachment (media) pages.
* We weren't building CPT links correctly resulting in bad navigation, which is now fixed.
* We removed the form legend for default Tiled Gallery settings as it doesn't relate.
* With shortcodes we now return early from processing them if no string is passed, as they are required.
