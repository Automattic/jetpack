Increase your traffic, view your stats, speed up your site, and protect yourself from hackers with Jetpack.

== Description ==

Jetpack simplifies managing WordPress sites by giving you visitor stats, security services, speeding up images, and helping you get more traffic. Jetpack is a free plugin.

= Traffic Growth & Insights =
Jetpack tells you how many visits your site gets and helps you **get more traffic** with tools like Related Posts, Publicize, Enhanced Distribution, and Sharing.

= Security =
Jetpack **protects your site** against brute force attacks and unauthorised logins. We also monitor your site for downtime and keep your plugins updated.

= Image Performance =
Jetpack automatically **optimizes and speeds up** images using the global WordPress.com content delivery network. This saves you hosting costs by reducing bandwidth.

= Centralized Management =
With Jetpack comes a **centralized dashboard** on WordPress.com. Manage plugins and menus, publish posts, and view enhanced site stats for all of your sites.

= A few more things that our users love =
Jetpack includes other features that help you customize your site including Custom CSS, Contact Forms, Galleries and Carousels, Notifications and Subscriptions, Configurable Widgets, and [many more](https://jetpack.com/features).

= Dedicated Support =
We have an entire team of happiness engineers ready to help you.  Ask your questions in the support forum, or [contact us directly](https://jetpack.com/contact-support).

= Contributing to Jetpack =

Jetpack is open-source and we actively encourage community contributions: whether it's a compliment, bug report, code, or an idea we welcome it with open arms! [Learn about contributing](https://jetpack.com/contribute) or consider [joining our beta program](https://jetpack.com/beta).

== Installation ==

[Install Jetpack from our site](https://jetpack.com/install?from=wporg) by typing in your site address.

Alternatively install Jetpack via the plugin directory, or by uploading the files manually to your server. After activating Jetpack, connect to WordPress.com to enable the Jetpack features.

If you need additional help [read our detailed instructions (including a video walkthrough)](http://jetpack.com/support/installing-jetpack/).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Jetpack free? =

Yes! The core features of Jetpack are and always will be free. Jetpack also integrates with paid services like Akismet (anti-spam), VaultPress (backups), and VideoPress (video hosting) but these are not required for Jetpack to function.

= Why do I need a WordPress.com account? =

Many of our core features (like Photon, Stats, and Protect) make use of the WordPress.com cloud. For this to happen Jetpack requires a (free) WordPress.com account. If you don't have one already you can easily create one during Jetpack's connection process.

= I already have a WordPress account, but it's not working. What's going on? =

A WordPress.com account is different to the one you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress. If you can log into https://wordpress.com then you already have a WordPress.com account. If you can't, you can easily create one during Jetpack's connection process.

= How do I view my stats? =

Once you've installed Jetpack your stats will be available via "Site Stats" which appears in the Jetpack menu (under your Dashboard menu within WordPress).

= How do I contribute to Jetpack? =

There are opportunities for developers at all levels to contribute. [Learn more about contributing to Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/contribute) or consider [joining our beta program](https://jetpack.com/beta).
