To learn more about the essential security and WordPress services we provide, visit our [plan comparison page](https://jetpack.com/pricing?from=wporg).

= Why do I need a WordPress.com account? =

Since Jetpack and its services are provided and hosted by WordPress.com, a WordPress.com account is required for Jetpack to function.

= I already have a WordPress account, but Jetpack isn't working. What's going on? =

A WordPress.com account is different from the account you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress. If you can log into [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com), then you already have a WordPress.com account. If you can't, you can easily create one [during installation](https://jetpack.com/install?from=wporg).

= How do I view my stats? =

Once you've installed Jetpack your stats will be available on [WordPress.com/Stats](https://wordpress.com/stats), on the official [WordPress mobile apps](https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/), and on your Jetpack dashboard.

= How do I contribute to Jetpack? =

There are opportunities for developers at all levels to contribute. [Learn more about contributing to Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/contribute) or consider [joining our beta program](https://jetpack.com/beta).

= 6.3.3 =

* Release date: July 30, 2018
* Release post: https://wp.me/p1moTy-9n0

**Facebook API Maintenance**

On the 1st of August, 2018 Facebook sunsets its API allowing to post updates to your Profile Page. Only the API allowing to post to Facebook Pages will remain. This required several changes to Jetpack that we are presenting in this release:

* Publicize: making sure we are handling existing connections gracefully.
* Publicize: using logo font instead of images to make the UI up to date and mobile ready.
* Publicize: removing the ability to select Facebook Profile connections in the UI.

**Bug fixes**

* General: properly handle Jetpack connection owner transition process.
