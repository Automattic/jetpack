To learn more about the essential security and WordPress services we provide, vist our [plan comparison page](https://jetpack.com/pricing?from=wporg).

= Why do I need a WordPress.com account? =

Since Jetpack and its services are provided and hosted by WordPress.com, a WordPress.com account is required for Jetpack to function.

= I already have a WordPress account, but Jetpack isn't working. What's going on? =

A WordPress.com account is different from the account you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress. If you can log into [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com), then you already have a WordPress.com account.

Once you've installed Jetpack your stats will be available on [WordPress.com/Stats](https://wordpress.com/stats), on the official [WordPress mobile apps](https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/), and on your Jetpack dashboard.

= How do I contribute to Jetpack? =
