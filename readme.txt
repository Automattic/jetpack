If you're interested in learning more about the extra layers of protection and advanced tools available, learn more about our [paid plans](https://jetpack.com/pricing).

= Why do I need a WordPress.com account? =

Since Jetpack and its services are provided and hosted by WordPress.com, a WordPress.com account is required for Jetpack to function.

A WordPress.com account is different from the account you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress.

Once you've installed Jetpack your stats will be available on [WordPress.com/Stats](https://wordpress.com/stats), on the official [WordPress mobile apps](https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/), and on your Jetpack dashboard.

* With shortcodes we now return early from processing them if no string is passed, as they are required.
