We're always improving Jetpack based on your feedback and WordPress development. [Subscribe to our mailing list](http://jetpack.me/coming-soon/) to get notified of new developments.



== Installation ==

1. Install Jetpack either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. After activating Jetpack, connect to WordPress.com to enable the Jetpack features.
3. Click the Connect button and log in to a WordPress.com account to authorize the Jetpack connection.
4. If you don't yet have a WordPress.com account, you can quickly create one after clicking the Connect button.
5. That's it.  You're ready to go!

If you need additional help [read our detailed instructions, including a video walkthrough](http://jetpack.me/support/installing-jetpack/).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have a WordPress account, but it's not working, what's going on? =

Jetpack requires a connection to [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) to enable all features. This is a different account than the one you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress. If you can log into http://wordpress.com, then you already have a WordPress.com account. If you can't, then you can easily create one as part of the installation of Jetpack.

= How do I view my stats? =

Once you've installed Jetpack, your stats will be available via the "Site Stats" menu which appears in the new Jetpack menu (under your Dashboard menu within WordPress).

= How do I contribute to Jetpack? =

Easy! There are opportunities for developers at all levels to contribute:

* Join our Beta Test group.
* Give us a hand answering questions in our [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack).
* Report bugs, with reproduction steps, or post patches on [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/Jetpack).
