= Why do I need a WordPress.com account? =

A WordPress.com account is different from the account you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress.

Once you've installed Jetpack your stats will be available on on [WordPress.com/Stats](https://wordpress.com/stats), on the official [WordPress mobile apps](https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/), and on your Jetpack dashboard.
